"All my life i've been going through shit (only 17 years old) and when things started to get better i crashed. I can't get myself to get out of bed no matter how much i try, my family understands but do still not approve since my grades dropped from all A's to E-C. It has been like this for 1-2 years now and none of my friends understands how It's like, I can't really blame them either since I don't like talking about it and i've always been taught to be a man and keep this stuff to myself. They just see a lazy fuck who is too irresponsible to go too school, same with my teachers. Idk if typing here is going to help at all but if anyone has some tips/advice on how to get motivated again i would be super happy.",Yes,"1. I identify explicit expressions of disconnection and isolation in the post with phrases like none of my friends understands how It's like and they just see a lazy fuck who is too irresponsible. These indicate a lack of support and understanding from peers, which enhances feelings of isolation.

2. The tone of the post is marked by sadness and frustration, emphasizing the writer's sense of being misunderstood and judged. Phrases like I can't get myself to get out of bed and my family understands but do still not approve reinforce the impression of Thwarted Belongingness, highlighting a struggle with acceptance and connection.

3. Contextual clues, such as the mention of always being taught to be a man and keep this stuff to myself,” indicate a repeated pattern of suppressing emotions and a lack of open communication, which suggests systemic barriers to forming connections that might alleviate feelings of rejection or exclusion.

4. The evidence consistently aligns with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness, as the post reflects a deep sense of disconnection from friends, misunderstandings from family and teachers, and an internalized belief that sharing struggles is not acceptable, all of which contribute to the sense of not belonging."
"Give me one good reason I should not kill myself right now. The whole world is going to shit and no one can change that. The only people that could help refuse to. The world will never be a good place, it will always be on the brink. Everyone always says to just look on the bright side, but what is the point? For every good thing you could say, I could name off 3 bad things. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just end it right now and save myself the trouble. Everyone dies eventually, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable. I house I can‚Äôt afford will be underwater anyways, if were not all dead by the time I need one. Everyone always says that I shouldn‚Äôt kill myself because people would be sad. Welp, I‚Äôm not a good person. I‚Äôm selfish, rude, hopeless, and just annoying in general. As is everyone.

"I saw this tumblr post going around the internet telling people to start the new year going to bed early and waking up refreshed, and I thought hell yes that sounds really nice, I should do that. Cause I'm superstitious and I always have this feeling at the back of my mind that however I start the year is going to be a premonition of how the rest of the year is going to be. For the past several years I've started the year either depressed, literally on the verge of suicide, or high as fuck, and the rest of the year always mirrored that, proving my paranoia right. So I said this year is going to be different. But it's 4:45am on jan 1st now and I'm drunk as hell because I ran out of weed so I couldn't sleep and now I'm suicidal as well and I can't help but feeling like 2018 is going to be a whole other year of drugs and booze and depression and it's like, what's the point?

"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",Yes,"1.

"I‚Äôm 16 I‚Äôve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‚Äòbusy‚Äô working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I‚Äôm now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I‚Äôve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I‚Äôm only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‚Äòpainless‚Äô suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù ‚Äú the only thing you have is self pity‚Äù etc. I just know I‚Äôm going to end it all pretty soon, I‚Äôm not sure when but almost definitely soon.

"I‚Äôm convinced that antidepressants don‚Äôt do shit. I‚Äôve been on bupropion, sertraline, risperidone and citalopram. None of them feel like they do anything.

"I am completely inlove with this man and from the beginning he has always very honest about his depression and how it has affected him etc. I just need advice from people as to how can I help him and how can I, simultaneously, be happy myself without being extremely affected by his state. Ive also realized that I‚Äôve been limiting myself to doing things that might trigger his depression or that it will worsen it. For example, he doesn‚Äôt really like going out but I enjoy the occasional dance night with my friends or something and I feel like he dreads me going out and if I do he gets really sad. So I‚Äôve tried to stay in, which is still fun for me,but if I ever want to go out i just don‚Äôt want to make him worse.

"I have two best friends and we all hang out together, except most of the time I don't want to hang out because I just can't bring myself to be around people and they are very introverted so I get worn out easily. They know I'm depressed but I think it's really difficult for them to actually relate or understand.

My body is already breaking down. I'm only 23 and I'm in constant fear of dying from my body refusing to take any more stress (traditional blacksmithing as a long-term goal, construction type work to afford to pursue it, both are pretty hard on the body) without any semblance of motivation to do so or happiness as a reward. I don't even remember what it's like to be happy. I don't want to be happy. I **want** to be unhappy. That's all I have, the ability to not need the thing that most people want so much, that they dedicate their entire life to get it.

She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons.

While I don‚Äôt have the constant urge to kill myself, it does appear in my mind a lot. Every so often per week the urge will (for a short period of time) come up again. In those moments I find myself lying on my stomach on my bed, my hands either stiffly folded behind my back, so that I can‚Äôt do anything to myself, or out in front of me gripping the edge of the bed, so that I can not in any way get up from my bed to harm myself. I find this tactic works, but I wish I didn‚Äôt have to use it. You see, there‚Äôs are times that I really, *really* want to‚Äîno I *need* to cry, but no tears come out. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm not dehydrated, so my body can afford to cry, but it just *doesn‚Äôt*. Instead I end up fighting to suppress tears at the most inconvenient moments. I feel so over-dramatic for making this post, because others who make these types of posts have *such better reason* behind theirs, and I feel as if my ""reason"", which is stated in the first few sentences, seems pathetic.

"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can‚Äôt I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butt‚Äôs too small, etc. Why can‚Äôt I see the good in myself? My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can‚Äôt help to think that I‚Äôm fat even though I have an average BMI at 5‚Äô5‚Äù , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day. I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how ‚Äúfat‚Äù she is when she‚Äôs half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn‚Äôt bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful.

"I‚Äôm trying to get out of my depression and bought a couple of self help/ motivation books to help me. I thought it would be easy filling out the answers but the first to-do was ‚Äúlist the things you do that make you happy‚Äù.

"For some of us, 2017 sucked. Relationships, friends (or lack of), grades, lost loved ones - whatever it may be, maybe this year was garbage. Personally (22/M), I just spent my fifth consecutive New Years alone - sitting here wondering why I'm still incapable of making any notable friendships at what some people consider to be the best/easiest age to socialize and make friends. Despite that, I'm convinced that sitting here listening to the fireworks alone isn't all that life has to offer - and maybe a change in attitude/habits will help me next year. By extension, I sincerely hope everyone reading this will have a better 2018 in whatever aspect of life is holding you down.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this. So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening. We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions.

It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I‚Äôm left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I‚Äôve never been the same since then. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don‚Äôt love me..you don‚Äôt care about me..It‚Äôs funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. When will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..Hopefully soon..but for now as I wait I‚Äôve decided to not cross any busy roads for you or climb any mountains..for now I will stay here even though it hurts I‚Äôm safer here by myself than with you.,Yes,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The phrases I cried myself to sleep, I went to bed hurting, and I will never be able to feel that love again explicitly express feelings of pain and isolation.

"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult. I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again. The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate.

"These boards are riddled with self contempt and self loathing, which is naturally what you might expect on depression boards. Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful. I've been a long time lurker on these forums, also suffering myself, and I see that many people feel support and solidarity with those suffering here. Yet I can't help but feel that we are all dragging each other down. You don't cure a disease by just communing with others who have the disease and complaining about your symptoms.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9. The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out. I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends. I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough. The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people. I have seen how people treat others who are different. They can be mean and cruel. Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise. I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it. People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself?

"My depression has always involved a lot of self blame, guilt, and self hatred, as well as anger and emptiness.

So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit.

Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep.

Other people have it a lot worse. I'm only 22, but I feel like I've somehow lived a hundred lifetimes. I used to be religious. Or at least I was forced to be religious. But I realize that even if God and heaven existed, I don't want to go to heaven. I'm only 22 and I already feel like I should be packing her in. Like I've lived long enough, and am exhausted.

I really need to focus on my music even if It kills me trying to reach my goals. What else is there for me to be alive for. I hate being biasd and hate most things in life.

"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects.

Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

I had been on Zoloft 50mg and even got down to 25 mg for anxiety and depression. But during the later months of the semester of college. I got hit like a truck.

Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change.

I'm so scared and sad. I'm trying to get better. It's like I'm trapped in my own mind. I dont want to drop college because I know it will hurt my future.

"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically. The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness? Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now.

"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun.

I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it?

I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon.

"I've been depressed most of my life. I know I should have seeked help long ago because, even now, I have never told my doctors that I'm depressed. When I was a young boy, gaming was my passion. I miss those days; no responsibilities and no meddlesome relationships to distract me from my pasttime. Now I'm much older and the depression hasn't waned a bit.

I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field. I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started.

This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do.

People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed.

I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed.

"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like, well, what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve.

"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise.

Be able to be worthy enough for the attention of this one guy in my school. I always see him. Always. But he just doesn't see me. I guess that's how it's supposed to be.

"I'm really into computers and gaming and shit, I have a 4k pc setup that's probably ~$3,000. 250 games, probably about 1,000 movies, 70,000 songs, nice speaker setup, studio headphones, you get the idea. I've loved this shit my entire life and in the last week I've realized that I don't even play games any more. Steam shows 0.0 hours played the last 2 weeks. I don't watch Netflix, I maybe listen to like 10 songs in a day, I used to have it on all the time. I basically just sit on Reddit refreshing the page hoping to see a news article that makes me think for .0001 seconds. I've been trying to hang out with my friends who are back in town for the holidays but I'm super fucking negative. All the stuff I would say in a conversation would be tearing down a person or an idea. My ""top 3"" friends leave today, tomorrow, and Friday. I'm gonna be stuck in a room with an entertainment system I don't even want to use. An entertainment system that I built specifically to keep me occupied because nothing else would. I thought I was drinking because I didn't care but now I realize I cared about recognizing my indifference. I really don't give a shit now. I was smoking weed whenever I got a chance. I don't even want to be high any more. I'm getting increasingly worried that my girlfriend sees me as a burden. She's the only other person I really talk to. She cares about me and goes out of her way to help me as much as she can, but you can only do that for so long, right? I feel hollow.",Yes,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging**: The post includes phrases such as I don't even play games anymore, I basically just sit on Reddit, I'm super fucking negative, and I'm gonna be stuck in a room with an entertainment system I don't even want to use.

"If you want to read more about my recent troubles, here is the previous thread I made about 2 weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5jquj6/i_failed_another_college_class_and_i_dont_know/ But basically I am 23 years old and a computer science major and I have recently just failed another semester of college and told my mother about it. She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me. Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis. I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things. Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy.

"I‚Äôve lived with depression for so long that it feels weird not to be depressed sometimes. I don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs almost as if I need my depression because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm comfortable with. It gets me through my ruts in life by making me feel nothing. But at the same time, it‚Äôs so pathetic. It keeps me from doing things I enjoy, and it makes me feel worthless and hopeless. It makes me think about suicide a lot too because I start to think about my future, like what the point is in living or if I can really handle anymore pain. (What is the point in life anyway? Work until you die?) But then it gets even worse when I realize I can‚Äôt end it, because of personal obligations based on relationships and religion. (Plus I‚Äôd never get to finish dark souls.

"I'm sorry if this seems to be a ramble, but I need to get this out. I've been reading this sub for a while, but made a new account to comment. Sometimes I find it helpful to get everything out, and I don't have anyone left to get things out to who won't try and pity me. Depression runs in my family, but I'm probably using that as a crutch or an excuse. I think I'm depressed. I go through stages of downs and (sort of) ups, though those usually manifest themselves as drives to fix the problems in my life - while never working out and making the situation worse. Today my girlfriend called me selfish. Truth is, it's her birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten her anything. She knows this, I haven't even gotten her a card. The reason is, I have a lot of personal debt - we both do. I spent my last ¬£2 on a sandwich yesterday so that I could eat, and now I have to hope that the rest of the month ""works out"" somehow. It's 13 days until pay day. I don't have a bad paid job, but circumstances this Christmas left me short for cash - I usually run out a few days before pay day not two weeks. She knows about my debt, some of it's hers, but I she doesn't seem to get it, how bad it is. I used to hurt myself.

"I used to have a great social life. Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text. It was one of the happiest times of my life. It was great until the next school year. Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons. When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school. Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill. I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text. I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school. My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in. In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school. I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone.

"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. Now I want to get back to life.

I‚Äôm currently failing what‚Äôs supposed to be my second to last semester of college. Everyone thinks I‚Äôm lazy, but I can feel the physical block. My therapist says it‚Äôs almost definitely related to my cPTSD. But I don‚Äôt know what to do. She doesn‚Äôt know either. Maybe I‚Äôm whining. I‚Äôm first-generation in my country. My mom moved here from a third world country with practically nothing. But I do feel like my body was not meant for this. If it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm weak, I‚Äôm not surprised.

So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her.

"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit. A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that.

And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit.

Idk why I'm posting this but I really just want to die, I have since I was 11 and have thought about it just about every day since I was around 13. I just don't see anything to look forward to in life. Every day I wake up and force myself to go to the gym, then sit around all day trying to find something good to watch or get enough energy to do something productive, then lie in bed and can never fall asleep within 6 hours.

"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that.

"A crisp white coating engulfed the road at 5am. Another sleepless night, another crunchy step taken on the path to escape. It's like a deathbed, cold yet in a way comforting. The dimly lit roads winding through the hills all seemingly leading nowhere but in an endless circle. A cruel metaphor of life. Trapping once beautiful souls, emptying them, and leaving nothing but a mere skeleton. A real world dementor. Intercepting excitement during the most joyous time of the year. Holiday spirit flows through the air but all you can feel is the dark aura you are confronted with. Yet somehow I'm coming to accept that it's okay. A newfound serenity in an alternate state.

"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights. What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten.

It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end? Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair. But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation.

Lately I started to burn myself with this acid pen (used to heal warts) - i just drip that acid on my skin and watch it burn my skin. then I concentrate on physical not emotional pain. I know I can't keep on going like this. besides working out, finding a hobby, reading books.. what else can I do to take my mind off of that? is there something I could do while I'm at work?

"My depression has been at its worst recently and I‚Äôve been trying desperately to find a therapist. The people I usually go through have told me it‚Äôs a 9 month waiting list and I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. I checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. I slept easier last night at the thought that I‚Äôd be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. I‚Äôm just so sick of trying to help myself. I know it‚Äôs not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. They shouldn‚Äôt allow people to apply if they aren‚Äôt going to be able to help or at least have a warning up. Everywhere I‚Äôve looked so far has said to either wait, go to A&amp;E or call 111 IF it‚Äôs an emergency. What classifies as an emergency? Because I‚Äôm almost certain I wouldn‚Äôt be considered one and I don‚Äôt want to waste their time considering the NHS is already stretched thin.

"My high school career wasnt the best but it certainly was full of great memories and long term friendships *(some of which I am still in contact with over a decade later)*.

I only have one more year to go, but I don't plan on doing a post graduate in the same course. How do I tell my parents?

"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it. The person who's pretty or at least average looking but at least they don't have a disfigured face people avoid as soon as they see you. If you're all of those. Or at least one.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me. My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done. Should I see a neurologist or another specialist?",No,"1.

"No matter how much I struggle, I always end up feeling awful and get off track from pursuing my goals. I want to study physics, but in my country there's literally only one decent uni where I can study physics and have a chance of going abroad for masters and a phd. I'm kinda confident in my intelligence so I think I have a good chance of getting in, but not like this. Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me.

"I have no reason to feel this way.

I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

"For years I had been telling myself that I would never be smart enough to get a scholarship, I would never go to university, I believed I would never succeed academically.

"Honestly I'm so tired of living life through failing at everything, I'm not good at anything and I fail to understand why and how people think and learn about everything in such a pragmatic and methodical way. Most people seem to fall within the norm and have socialized support when growing up, I've had none of this (Nor have I been parented properly, I've just been expected to ""Fall into place"") as I have social anxiety and very rarely have had any discussions with people other than online and even they are limited.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**: The tone conveys a mix of uncertainty and a desire for connection, which reflects feelings of sadness and loneliness. Expressions like crippling depression and it didn't seem like they really knew how to help reinforce a sense of exclusion and frustration. The hope at the end for a potential positive experience in a future group indicates a longing for belonging.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: The repeated references to feeling different due to having DID and BPD, along with previous negative experiences in therapy and process groups, suggest a pattern of feeling misunderstood and alone in their struggles. The mention of shifting personalities and interactions that feel disjointed (it's me but not me) supports the idea of ongoing internal conflict and isolation from others.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: The clues presented—discomfort in group settings, a sense of difference from peers, feelings of being misunderstood by therapists, and internal conflicts—consistently support the conclusion of Thwarted Belongingness. Each expression of disconnection and longing for genuine connection aligns with the central concept of feeling unable to achieve a sense of belonging."
Bonus points if you plead with a cab driver to drop you off at a famous-for-suicides bridge so you can jump off.,No,"1. The post contains an explicit expression of disconnection and isolation through the phrase plead with a cab driver to drop you off at a famous-for-suicides bridge. This indicates a desire to reach a location associated with despair and potential self-harm, suggesting a profound sense of not belonging or being emotionally detached.

The act of pleading for a cab driver to take one to such a location implies a deep-seated sense of despair and the feeling of being unsupported or unconnected to others, indicating a recurring theme of isolation.

Each clue—pleading for help with a focus on a location tied to suicides, the bleakness of the situation, and the implied emotional detachment—supports the interpretation that the individual is experiencing severe feelings of disconnection and lack of belonging."
"So, I've been trying to work on a research paper since October, and everything I came up with, my professor turned down. Around the end of November, right before Thanksgiving, my professor gave me a topic and a list of books. I took it because what other choice did I have? My professor knows I work two jobs, commute an hour to school everyday and an hour home, and suffer from bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. On top of this, I was taking four other classes that were just as demanding. Here I am now, sitting at my desk, looking at this pile of books, and I'm starting to physically hit myself with them from stress and anxiety. I have no idea what to do. Part of me wants to take this ""F"" on the class and drop out, but another part of me knows how horrible that would be and how much disappointment I'll be filled with, not to mention my family. I just am completely miserable and lost.",Yes,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**:
   - Phrases such as I have no idea what to do, I’m starting to physically hit myself with them from stress and anxiety, and I just am completely miserable and lost indicate feelings of confusion and distress. Additionally, the mention of struggling with multiple responsibilities and mental health issues suggests a sense of being overwhelmed and potentially isolated in dealing with these challenges.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**:
   - The tone of the post is primarily sad and anxious. Words like miserable, lost, and disappointment create an impression of deep emotional struggle. This tone reinforces the idea of Thwarted Belongingness as it reflects feelings of being unsupported and overwhelmed.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**:
   - The writer describes ongoing pressure from academic expectations (everything I came up with, my professor turned down) and the burden of managing mental health issues alongside their studies and jobs. This suggests repeated experiences of frustration and potential feelings of being unheard or unsupported in their academic and personal life.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**:
   - The evidence provided in the post consistently aligns with Thwarted Belongingness. The individual expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and disconnected from supportive relationships, as indicated by their struggles with their professor and mental health.

"I got the news that one of my mates I went to school with when I was studying abroad recently passed and I can't quite process it. I can't say I was close to him but it's just I've never had a friend die. I am close with someone who was close to him and she seems devastated. It feels weird, feels weird to say he has passed. I'm confused and shocked. Idk",Yes,"1. Identifying explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging: The post mentions I've never had a friend die, which suggests a lack of personal connection or an experience that ties the author to their social circle. The phrase it feels weird indicates a sense of confusion and a struggle to process the emotional experience, suggesting a disconnect from the expected feelings of grief shared with others.

2. Evaluating the tone of the post: The tone conveys confusion and shock, reflecting an emotional struggle rather than sadness or deep mourning. However, the lack of closeness to the deceased and the acknowledgment of another person's devastation points to a feeling of isolation in processing emotions, reinforcing the sense of Thwarted Belongingness.

3. Considering contextual clues indicating repeated patterns: While the overall post doesn’t explicitly reference being ignored or excluded, the author’s feeling of confusion suggests a lack of emotional support in processing grief. The absence of a personal connection is also an indicator that there may be a history of feeling distanced from social relationships.

4. Verifying whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness: The evidence indicates the author is grappling with a significant emotional event (the death of a peer) but feels disconnected and unable to share in collective grief due to their insufficient bond with the deceased and perhaps with their close friend. This lack of connection and the struggle to process emotions aligns with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness, where one feels a lack of social belonging during a time of emotional need."
"I have no plan. My homework is building up and I can‚Äôt concentrate to to do at home or at school. If I can‚Äôt even do easy schoolwork how am I even be able to handle the workload of a real job? Yes I could just forget about it right now and postpone it. But that doesn‚Äôt solve tomorrow‚Äôs math test i haven‚Äôt studyed for. Just because I could stop worrying about it right now, it won‚Äôt stop me from worrying about it in the future when I feel like I have to go on. It‚Äôs a trap because every time I get the rope out I feel better because it takes away the future problems. But then once I feel better and put the rope away, all the problems come back.",No,"1. Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post:
   - The phrase I have no plan expresses a sense of confusion and lack of direction, contributing to feelings of isolation regarding planning and managing responsibilities.
   - I can’t concentrate to do at home or at school highlights difficulty with focus that could suggest a disconnect from both home and school environments.
   - But that doesn’t solve tomorrow’s math test implies a feeling of being overwhelmed and unable to engage with academic expectations, suggesting isolation in academic capability.

2. Evaluate the tone of the post:
   - The tone conveys desperation and anxiety, as visible in phrases like I have no plan and continuous worry about academic performance. This reinforces the impression of Thwarted Belongingness, indicating feelings of being lost and disconnected from the support typically found in educational settings.

3. Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings:
   - The mention of worry regarding future responsibilities suggests a recurring pattern of anxiety about performance and responsibilities. Every time I get the rope out I feel better indicates a temporary relief from anxiety but ties back to the ongoing issue of persistent worry and lack of control over school-related tasks.
   - The phrase all the problems come back emphasizes the cyclical nature of these feelings, showing a pattern of feeling overwhelmed and isolated by ongoing struggles.

4. Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness:
   - The explicit expressions of lack of a plan, inability to concentrate, and feelings of being trapped by responsibilities all point toward a lack of connection to both academic and future-oriented goals. 
   - The tone and context of worry and repeated feelings of being overwhelmed consistently align with Thwarted Belongingness, as the individual feels disconnected from support systems (home/school) that would typically help manage these stresses."
"Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed? Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...",Yes,"1. Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post.

He has a girlfriend, his own place, motorcycles, a truck, takes his girlfriend to dinners. All on the same pay rate as me. I barely get by with rent to my parents, food, and miscellaneous things that I need to live. How the fuck does he do that? Someone I know had a nice car.

   - The comparison to others who seem to be more fortunate or social, such as the co-worker with a girlfriend and a better lifestyle (makes the same that I do, has a girlfriend, his own place) reinforces feelings of disconnection.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**:
   - The tone is one of frustration and sadness, as evident by the repeated questioning and expressions of envy (How and why??). This tone suggests a deep sense of exclusion and dissatisfaction with one's current situation.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**:
   - The author reflects on comparison with peers and experiences of disappointment consistently. Phrases indicating envy (People are luckier than me) and confusion about others’ success (How does he find stupid suckers) suggest a narrative of chronic feelings of exclusion and inadequacy.

"Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing. I do that because I feel I‚Äôm supposed to be the fun one in the group, and while I think I am (I always make them and myself laugh), if I get super serious they‚Äôll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried and tell someone. I don‚Äôt want any of those to happen. Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn‚Äôt need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don‚Äôt want to annoy her with how much I‚Äôve been telling her. Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she‚Äôs been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that‚Äôs the truth.

Phrases such as only one out of my tons of friends, if I get super serious they’ll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried, and I feel like I’m being a nuisance illustrate feelings of isolation and fear of rejection.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**: The tone conveys sadness and loneliness, particularly in the author's concern about burdening their best friend with serious topics. Phrases like I’m starting to feel like I’m being a nuisance and the mention of suicidal thoughts contribute to an overall impression of emotional distress and exclusion from meaningful social interaction.

"My heart is screaming, my soul (and my right arm due to self harm) is bleeding and burning, I am feeling lower and lower each day that passes, I feel more and more like I will explode, several personnal reasons caused me to feel this way (sexual bias, poverty, loneliness, studies, ill relatives, I am also possibly underdiagnosed when it comes to my mental health) but I don't know how to ask for help. I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to. I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol. Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it.

"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends.

"It's new years but that hasn't sparked this post. This post was created out of loneliness. I always find myself feeling so stupid, but I am just not satisfied and if i'm stupid so be it. I thought getting financial freedom would bring me happiness, and it hasn't. I'm even more sad now that I have no obligations. I just keep thinking about the point to anything, and I can never find it. The only thing that keeps me happy is listening to very old vocaloid songs, but no one ever wants to listen to vocaloid with me. It makes sense though, i'm a 21 year old man now and it doesn't make sense for me to enjoy such a dumb and girly and cringy type of music, I get it.

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed. Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to.

I'm also really self-obsessed and ungrateful, I'm realising. I don't message back people that are very good to me, I'm only ever looking out for myself, I don't make an effort to see my lifelong friend too much. Well I have a lot of work to do.

"Things that didn't bother me in the past are now sending me into a deep depression. You know when you're talking to someone about something you're passionate about, but they just dont care? You know when that seems to happen with every interest and every person? Thats happening to me constantly lately. I guess it always did but I didnt think about it so hard in the past. Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest.

"I find myself frequenting this sub a lot, usual late at night listening to some music. The problem is personally I do not suffer from any sort of depression. In fact I'm glad that I consider my life is pretty decent, albeit with a few shortcomings. Being the start of a new year I see many posts here talking about self improvement and finally fighting the problems that have been plaguing some people for years.

"I feel nothing. I have been feeling like this for a long time. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel sad, but for the most part I don't feel anything at all. I think the last time I cried was probably 10 years ago. Two days ago I was watching Bojack Horseman, and one of the episodes hit me for some reason.

In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness.

Sometimes it feels like i'm from a different planet, and that's something I'm just going to have to live with. But this isn't about me, it's about all of you. This is the only place I can talk about my feelings, because nobody else would understand. And it's not that anyone here understands, it's that people here are supportive, whether or not they really understand. I always delete everything I post, but the odd comment, it always draws out feelings that would otherwise just churn inside of me. I'm not sure if it makes me feel better, or sadder. But they're both distinct from feeling worse. To everyone here, who is supportive, and who has given me support in the past, I thank you. There's so much I want to say, but I'll try to keep this brief and if I really need to say it, i'll say it later. Thanks guys.",Yes,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The phrases Sometimes it feels like I'm from a different planet, and this is the only place I can talk about my feelings, because nobody else would understand indicate a strong sense of disconnection and isolation from others. The expression of having to live with this feeling reinforces the notion of being out of place or not belonging.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**: The tone of this post reflects sadness and loneliness. Phrases such as I've felt so bad, I still feel bad, and I always delete everything I post convey a sense of emotional struggle and inner turmoil. This tone certainly reinforces the impression of Thwarted Belongingness, as it indicates a search for connection amidst feelings of sadness.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: The mention of feeling like nobody else would understand and the necessity to come to this particular community for support indicates a pattern of feeling ignored or excluded from other social interactions. Additionally, the struggle of feelings churning inside of me further highlights a persistent experience of isolation and the challenges of expressing those emotions.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: All the identified expressions and the overall tone point towards an experience consistent with Thwarted Belongingness.

"My fianc√© is the one who I talk to most about how I‚Äôm feeling and is the one who encouraged me to ask my mom for help, but I had no idea how to break the news to her. My whole life she has talked about how my dad was always so bad because he was bipolar and didn‚Äôt take his medication so I always associated bipolar disorder to raging, abusive behavior and I‚Äôm not like that at all. I didn‚Äôt want her to either belittle my feelings or freak out. Then one night I got drunk and I can‚Äôt even remember how it got brought up, but I remember ugly crying to my mom about how over the past almost 5 years something has changed with me mentally and I‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts that have increased with time. I‚Äôve always been depressed feeling and I self harmed when I was a teenager, but it was never like this. I think child birth triggered something because this all started with the intense sadness after having my first son (I‚Äôm assuming it was Postpartum Depression, but I never reached out. I was ashamed.) but the suicidal thoughts have increased over the past year and a half and I feel the shift in the manic and depression phases. Even my friends think I‚Äôm ignoring them because I go from chatty and outgoing to MIA for weeks.

"It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time. The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it. Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that.

"Look I'm not that depressed. I have mild depression. But . I don't feel alive. I can feel the wind and rain and I can see the hills and the windmills but I can't FEEL them.

"I'm 17, and I fucked up real bad. Yesterday I went to a party to celebrate New Year's. I got so mad with my only friend that I told him to fuck off and that he should just forget my complete existence. When my brothers saw that they just tried to help me, and I told them too to fuck off and went outside to punch the wall until my hands started to bleed. I blocked everyone on Whatsapp, and now I'm completely alone and my family is worried. I don't know what to tell them. How do I tell them that every single day of my life is a constant pain and urge of jumping off the window? How the fuck I make them understand? I think I did the worst mistake in my whole life, and I'm afraid there's no way out. Suicide feels easier every day that passes, and now the will to do it is bigger than ever.

"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that.

I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago.

"Hey ya'll. Hope everyone is having a decent start to the new year.

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice?

"What‚Äôs it like when you come out of a depressive episode? I know it‚Äôs not sudden for most. I just want to know because although I haven‚Äôt been depressed my whole life, I have been in a very deep depressive episode the past year and a half and my memory is appalling. I‚Äôve genuinely totally forgotten most of my life, especially how I felt during previous periods of time.

"So I went to a stupid therapist last week because of the self harm and suicide thing with my school. I dont really want help but I was at least hoping for some help with my mental health. That didnt happen, instead I'm going to get tested for autism (asperger's). I dont think that having autism is bad but that's not really what i wanted, I wanted to sort out my mental health and all she did was take down all the things that could mean I'm autistic.

"I hate waking up every morning for school. Im pretty good at it, i have lots of friends there, but it bores the shit out of me, and i spend the whole day thinking about coming home and smoking weed.

"I finally got some form of disability for my epilepsy, it's not much but I am no longer worrying about money. I don't have to ever worry about working another factory or fastfood job again. I can finally afford to and focus on school. I will never get my learners permit or driver's license still. But I pretty much gave up on that as soon as I was diagnosed. I am really passionate about animation so I feel so blessed to be able to pursue that now. Funny how a lil extra cash can make life a lot better. A lot of you on here were amazing and I have nothing but good things to say about ya'll. I wuv u all. :3",No,"1. The post primarily expresses positive sentiments about receiving disability support and being able to focus on school and passion for animation.

2. The tone of the post is predominantly positive and hopeful related to newfound financial stability and pursuing passions. However, there is an underlying sense of loss or resignation (e.g., mentioning the inability to obtain a driver's license) that may suggest feelings of isolation or exclusion compared to typical life experiences.

3. There is a hint of a pattern of thwarted belongingness indicated by the mention of giving up on getting a driver's license as soon as I was diagnosed. This suggests a history of experiences leading to feelings of exclusion or a lack of belonging connected to the disability. However, the overall message shifts towards a sense of appreciation for support received from the community, which contrasts with feelings of exclusion.

4. The evidence does suggest elements that align with Thwarted Belongingness, especially in the context of the limitations imposed by the disability. However, the post primarily focuses on positive developments and support received from others, which somewhat dilutes the strong representation of thwarted belongingness. While there are indications of isolation, they do not dominate the narrative."

"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time. I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me.

"OK so here goes the story, please help. We¬¥ve been dating long-distance for 3 years. He used to love me to the moon and back. He¬¥s from NZ and I¬¥m from Mexico, he¬¥s 22 and I¬¥m 31. He had already broken up with me 3 months ago saying that his feelings for me were fading away but he already had a plain ticket to come see me for November. 3 days ago he broke up with me saying that he needs to be alone, that he needs to figure things out, that the distance is too hard (We were planning on me moving there in 2 years until he finished university) we already had been through 3 years together, 3 very hard years as well where my father died and I lost my mind to depression and anxiety. He says he doesn't love me anymore at least not like a partner but that he¬¥ll always love me as a friend. Could this be the depression? he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he just wants to be alone. I don't know what to do here since I was working a job that I didn't really liked but that would give me lots of job opportunities in NZ i was planning my future around him. I battled depression as well and the last thought in my mind was breaking up with him. Which is why I can¬¥t understand why he broke up with me.

"I'm a 20 year old male college student. Before college and the year and a half hell I've been living in, I always felt like happiness did not come easily to me. I recognized early on that unlike my friends, I had to actively work for any semblance of happiness and peace. Once I started college, my old friend sexual performance anxiety came back full force and hasn't left. Being at one of the nations biggest party schools and mecca for beautiful girls my age, feeling left out of the one thing that all human cultures around the world share feels bad man. This has created a gaping hole inside me that I fill with booze and pot. I've been at rock bottom for a while now, and I know that recovering from this depression and involuntary celibacy will be the hardest battle I've yet to fight in my life. I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet. Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you. After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change. When I look into my future, I see years of battling this dark and disparaging side of me.

"I'm posting here for the first time on my main reddit account. People I know will probably see this, they'll probably laugh, but I don't care anymore. I need to vent my feelings someplace. I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help. I need to fix myself, i'm a broken person. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore, honestly.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: The evidence consistently aligns with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness.

"About a year ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for someone to talk to. A user by the name ""Ryfflex"" contacted me. We talked, for a couple of months off and on before my life had gotten too busy and I hadn't had time to check up or get back to you. I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account (you had mentioned it was a throw away) but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still 'okay'. I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others, now I want to check up on you.

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now.

I thought I‚Äôve been getting better but realized that I‚Äôm actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It‚Äôs to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of this you‚Äôd think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don‚Äôt like me and I don‚Äôt blame them. How could you like someone who can‚Äôt express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn‚Äôt going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend.

"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with.

"I dont know if this is the right sub, I just need a place to vent right now. So, I dont know where to start.

"I've been on and off depression for my entire life, sometimes it can be triggered by a traumatic event, but in most cases it just happens. I have friends, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and I have hobbies that make me happy. However, I still go through episodes of just feeling completely alone, sad, and suicidal. I'm at the point where I've just accepted it and try to roll with it until it goes away for a few days and I can feel somewhat normal. But unfortunately, none of my family or friends can really understand it. They get angry at me for being depressed or spending days locked in my room.

Oh well another day that I can't wait till it's over"" I feel empty emotionless and sad I have been feeling like this for years(4 years). I thought about ending it millions of times. It's still tempting to this day. I wish I would have someone to talk to but I don't want to burden anyone with my feelings.

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics. Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal. It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide. She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it. If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient. This is just not a possibility with her at this moment. There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do. I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help. If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.

"I can't be the only one putting myself down all the time? It's like when there is a brightening in the air, I find something wrong mostly with my body and I get frustrated, angry and sad at the same time. It's like I'm not meant to be happy and enjoy life... It has made me lose my curiosity for life and all the things within it, understanding how something works, and I hate myself for it, as this have been one of the biggest drives for me in all my life. I could get excited just about a small idea popping in my head. Today no ideas are floating, my brain is empty, meds, depression or just myself?

But, a good mother would accept her son any way that he is. My older brother is a narcissistic, arrogant asshole who I can't spend more than 3 minutes talking to before my head wants to explode because he does't actually listen to anything I ever say and still treats me like I'm 10. But guess fucking what? He's the favorite of my family. My grandpa and grandma, though they would never admit, clearly favorite him quite a lot compared to my sister, cousins and myself. Every time I go to a family dinner it's anything but family time because a huge argument always occurs at the table, which causes my grandma or aunt to get upset and cry. I don't know why they always have to argue over something. Also, I'm going to art school in the fall and nobody takes my art passion at all serious because I'm not choosing to follow the same typical conventional path as everyone else and become a lawyer/doctor/teacher or something similar. Seriously, when I bring it up it's almost like a joke to them.

I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard. Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep, that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them.

"I'm so incredibly stupid to ever think that this person would appreciate positive attention. I should've never cared about a person in the state that I'm in because it has made me so fragile.

"I have nobody to talk to. I find it hard to open to talk to people about things. Sometimes if someone asks me something, I can just see in their face that they are losing interest. People really don't give a shit what I have to say about anything. I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression. My SO has been pulling away from me and left me all alone last night because she didn't want to sit home with me and had already made plans with someone without me and didn't even mention anything until she was leaving. I sat home alone and drank myself sick until 3:45 when she finally came home. She didn't even say a word to me. Whenever I try to talk about things, it just ends up back in a circle and we have been in a weird rut for a long time. I have never felt so alone in my life and maybe not as low as this in a long time. I just needed to vent things. I am not looking forward to another year of shit like 2017.

"Perpetually asked if you're ok and always respond with "" I'm fine "". It's pathetic I know, but I always just want someone to reach out and just know that I'm not fine.

I can't tell my friends because none are close enough and even if they were... they wouldn't care. They'd care on the surface, but the next day it's back to their lives and that's that.

But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. I‚Äôm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone.

I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her.

"I have both depression and anxiety so it may be more of an anxiety thing, it's hard for me to tell.

Folks, I'm going to be in therapy a long time, a long, long time. Why? That's what helps me from running off the road.

"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. I‚Äôm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. I‚Äôve had to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù for such a long time and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research I‚Äôve sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method.

But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and I‚Äôve been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it. It wasn‚Äôt as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasn‚Äôt great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated.

"I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was.

"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow.

They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them.

Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"".

"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I‚Äôm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven‚Äôt got any migraines. I‚Äôm really really glad the medication is helping.

"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive).

"On the last day of 2017 I've decided that 2018 will either be my make or break year. 2017 has been a shit show. Not too different from previous years but this one just takes the cake. Literally the most disappointing,heartbreaking year ever. Too painful to even write out here, I just want to forget. Sometimes the only way i can sleep is thinking about dying. Sometimes i hope that i just wont wake up at all. There was a light at the end of the tunnel towards the end of the year but once I started to become happy it, of course, all cam crashing down. Ironically, once i tried to become closer to God and be a better person it all went to hell. I hate being depressed. I want this to be the last new years I spend crying and miserable.

Academically, spiritually, relationship wise. I want to be happy. If not I might just have to give up.

"I'm 20, and a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression in high school, but thought I got over it for the most part. When I'm at college and surrounded by friends, I feel great. But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified. I don't know if it's anxiety or depression or a mix of both, but I just feel like trash and I don't want to exist (no worries though; I'd be posting this on r/suicidewatch if i thought I was actually considering acting on that feeling.) I am sad. I don't have friends at home really, and I guess this has me all wondering, am I just predisposed to being sad? Like if I'm only happy when I'm busy and with other people, then is my natural state of being just being a pile of shit? And does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm good as long as I'm distracted I guess. But when I'm on break, all I do is lay in bed and fuck around with the computer or video games. I have nothing to do or think about, so the things I end up thinking about are all negative. I don't hate myself or anything; I'm just sad and don't really wanna be (be as in exist, not as in ""don't wanna be sad,"" i now see how the syntax there mighta been confusing) (though ideally i wouldn't be sad either) (lastly feel like i gotta say it one more time: seriously am not gonna kill myself.

"There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around.

"All the time I've lost to this disease, the contribution it's made to awful sleep, insomnia, and bad health in general.

I don‚Äôt have the same humor, mindset, hobbies or interests of these fucking people but I won‚Äôt conform to them either. Don‚Äôt even sound like any of them. Living in the Bay Area makes it even worse cause there‚Äôs this new cancer generation of tech assholes over here.

2. The tone of the post is predominantly sad and frustrated, with expressions of loneliness such as Want to kill myself indicating deep despair. This reinforces the impression of Thwarted Belongingness, highlighting feelings of exclusion and a lack of meaningful connections.

3. Contextual clues pointing to repeated patterns of such feelings include the statements about never having friends or intimate relationships from formative years, ongoing discomfort in the current environment (Living in the Bay Area makes it even worse), and general observations about a lack of authenticity in the people around (No ones kind or genuine anymore).

"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become. Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.",No,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The author references their past experiences during the ages of 15-16, stating, I couldn't see any reason to keep living and I thought I was nothing special. These phrases indicate a sense of hopelessness and feelings of inadequacy, suggesting disconnection from a sense of worth or belonging.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**: The tone begins with elements of sadness and isolation, particularly with the phrases related to their darkest moments. However, it shifts to a more hopeful tone as the author reflects on their personal growth and achievements, emphasizing a newfound gratitude and appreciation for life. The initial tone does support the impression of Thwarted Belongingness, even if it evolves positively later.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: The author's mention of feeling like nothing special and their experience of hardship over an 8-year span implies a pattern of negative feelings regarding their self-worth and belonging. The contrast between this initial phase and their current flourishing existence highlights a significant transformation, suggesting that there were indeed prolonged feelings of isolation before their recovery.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: All the clues support the conclusion of Thwarted Belongingness. The early mention of despair, feelings of inadequacy, and inability to foresee a better future strongly indicate a lack of belonging or connection to others.

"Hey r/depression. I am in therapy (although very irregularly due to financial restrictions) and I have loving friends and family members yet I do not know how to ask for help. I saw my therapist last week for the first time in a few months (I was doing absolutely awful during those) and pretended like everyhing is okay. I have talked to her about my issues before and she even helped me find a psychiatrist. My friends and some family members also offer support and repeatedly tell me that I just need to hit them up if I need help. Because I feel like I'm just a burden on everyone who has ever interacted with me before I never do so. How the hell do I get over myself and actually ask others for help? What would I even say? I can't just walk up to someone and go ""I want to die and I feel like I am unable to cope with just existing."" tl;dr not able to ask for help because I feel like I annoy everyone. How do I get over this issue?",No,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The author expresses feeling like a burden on everyone, which indicates a perception of being an imposition on their support network.

"hey everyone. I have been struggling with pretty severe depression since I was very young. I don't really remember a time where I felt normal. Anyway, I feel like tons of bad shit happens to me. Maybe there is something wrong with me.. im not too sure. Probably at this point. I recently went through an abusive relationship and it caused me to be even more fucked up than ever. Now I am just struggling and hurting inside. I recently found someone who I think is a good person and im not sure. I just dont think that I can ever have a functional relationship because of how bad my depression is. Also, I think that people get bored of me and see me as worthless sometimes.

"NOTE: I used this Instagram account to post a meme, and did not assume the identity of anyone else nor did I use any photos of people. ----- I have an interest in this guy, so I decided to follow his Instagram with a fake meme account one I made. I don't know why I didn't make a real one in retrospect, but I'm not going to take the chance of making a second one with my true identity because that would look even more suspicious, right? I see why I stay away from social media. I made a decision that probably made him view me as a creep. I created an instagram account, and tried to post some jokes, because I wanted him to think I was funny. It was my attempt at communication, under disguise. It was stupid in retrospect and I won't ever do it again. But honestly, I want to know what I can do to fix this, because I don't want him to view me in a weird way. I just wanted to be closer to him. I'm depressed on this issue.",No,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post.

"I mean, it's fucking awful man, I remember I used to help people left an right, and now, I don't know, I make people cry for no good reason, I feel fucking awful, I know that I shouldn't be so mean to everyone, I know that they're only trying to help, but I only know it afterwards, I only understand afterwards that I was a huge asshole, but never in the moment, and I hate it. The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know I remember being there for everyone when they needed help, but now?

"I‚Äôve noticed my younger brother (18) has been having some depressive thoughts. We live in different cities. I‚Äôm so glad that he‚Äôs able to be vulnerable with me and tell me when he‚Äôs feeling down, but I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I think I might be the only one in the family he‚Äôs talking to.

"you know how people always say ""you're lonely, not alone""? i really honestly feel like i'm just unable to become close to another human being - mutually. i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them. i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me. closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy. i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again. i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it. i just don't understand why i shouldn't just kill myself over spring break. that way if i survive, i have a week to be in the psych hospital and not miss any assignments or exams.",Yes,"1.

"Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says ‚Äòisolate yourself from your friends and family‚Äô, do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says ‚Äòavoid all your problems‚Äô, face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off! You deserve much better. This is much easier said than done, but if you‚Äôre like me and you enjoy being a contrary little bitch, be a contrary little bitch to depression!",Yes,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The post discusses the suggestion to isolate yourself from your friends and family, indicating a struggle with feelings of disconnection.

However, the acknowledgment of depression’s influence points to underlying feelings of sadness and isolation, reinforcing some level of Thwarted Belongingness.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: The mention of isolating from friends and family as a response to depression can imply a pattern of withdrawal that leads to feelings of loneliness.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: While the post does mention a tendency towards isolation due to depression, it is countered by the advice to seek out connection, which signifies a desire to overcome feelings of disconnection.

"A big issue I have with my depression is my inability to keep my house clean. I have lived in clean homes my entire life. I know how to clean and keep things clean. When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean. For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room).

She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services. I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting. Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight.

"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me. I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void.

Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight.

Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything!

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess.

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping. Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance. So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way. Thank you for listening, I hope it makes more sense than I think it does.",Yes,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The author mentions having dealt with a couple sexual assaults, which implies a deep sense of trauma and isolation. Phrases like I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed, suggest an avoidance and withdrawal from normal life and social interactions.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: The author references a pattern of coping that has not been consistent, indicating ongoing struggles. The inability to schedule appointments with the therapist due to potential loss of health insurance signifies a worry about losing crucial support as well as the feeling of being unsupported or abandoned at a critical time.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: Each clue aligns with Thwarted Belongingness; the experiences of trauma isolate the author, the reliance on parents who may not provide sufficient support contributes to disconnection, and the anxiety surrounding healthcare and therapy illustrates a lack of access to necessary social and emotional support.

"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy. So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer.

"But he wants to walk through them. It's an... oddly fascinating view I see when I look at myself outside this black bubble. I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between. Someone once read me this: ""Even the dimmest spots Would now feel bright For only in darkness Do you best see light."" Happy new year guys.",No,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The author expresses feelings of being trapped in a black bubble and refers to being in a vantablack-coated hellhole, indicating a profound sense of isolation.

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment.

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it. Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all.

"About two years ago, I was having issues with my mental health, and I was given Prozac.

I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.",Yes,"1.

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me... I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do. I might consider myself in a somewhat critical state of emotion right now, as I feel too sad to leave the house, or even my room. Please help me...",Yes,"1.

"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.) What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it."" Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way. But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain."" I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things. Just please stop telling me I'm going to be okay, and listen to me when I say I'm not.",Yes,"1. Explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging: The post contains phrases such as What I would give for someone to say, 'I understand you're struggling,' and I want to be heard; I want to be understood.

"One person wished me a merry Christmas. one person wished me a happy new year. one person called to see if I was doing anything. He is literally my only friend.

"Good Evening, everyone. I landed a job interview tomorrow. It's my first job interview since I got fired from my old job and checked into a mental institution/rehab February 2017. I've been clean and sober since the 23rd of February, and got on a mixture of different antidepressants (Lexapro, Mirtazapine, Seroquel). I'm anxious as hell and I feel like I'll fuck this up.

"I‚Äòm just so obsessed, with how I should look and appear to others. My mind always strives for perfection and I get very upset and worried when I don‚Äòt achieve that.

"Hi guys, Looking for any help I can get! I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.) I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember. I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked.

"Every single moment of my life lately has been absolute torture, and filled with mental anguish. There is not many things i'd rather do at the moment besides kill myself. The problem is that I can't for one major reason. It would completely destroy my dad, and might kill him in the process too. My father and I have a special bond that you don't find with many people nowadays; we aren't just family, we are best friends. My father is the only person I can really speak my mind to, and he has said that I am his only true friend. My father has been through some dark places lately, too. It feels like the universe won't let him keep anything good for too long. He's lost about 5 jobs over the past month, through no fault of his own. My mother and the love of his life said no to his marriage proposal and left him. His parents give him 0 encouragement for anything. I won't go into any more detail about him as I'm afraid he'll find this post by some luck, and the fact that I've been rambling. The point is that if I kill myself, that would just be one more layer on top of the shit sandwich he's had to slowly eat. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to tell somebody about this, as it's been eating me from the inside out. Does anybody have a similar experience they want to get off of their chest?",Yes,"1.

3. Considering contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings: The reference to the father's struggles—losing jobs, a failed marriage proposal, and lack of encouragement—suggests that the father is also experiencing significant difficulties. This shared burden may compound the feelings of disconnection from broader social support systems.

The mention of needing to tell somebody underscores a lack of safe spaces for sharing their experience, exhibiting further disconnection from a wider support network. Each clue directly supports the conclusion of feeling thwarted in their need for belonging and connection."
"I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline. For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression. I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken. And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me. Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to.

"Like right now. Just sitting here back in my home town during the holidays. Still fighting wicked depression and anxiety, and having to fly back across country in two weeks. Just sitting here alone at the kitchen table listening to some Linkin Park style music, sipping on a Stella and I realized how often I get caught in this daze and how I almost enjoy it. Like I‚Äôm allowing the pain in. Soaking in it. The music obviously amplifies it. I think about the decisions I‚Äôve made that have caused me greater pain. More stress. I think about what my future holds. If I can make it until then. I think about the present. If I‚Äôm meeting everyone‚Äôs standards that they all know of me. Think, think and more thinking.

"I‚Äôve always had issues with dissociation, but since I started taking meds for my depression it just seems to be a constant thing. I hate it, I feel like I‚Äôm not even human anymore. I feel more like a robot. Everybody says they‚Äôve seen such a difference in me since I started taking them, but I‚Äôm not feeling better. I‚Äôm not feeling anything.

"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to.

"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry. WHAT I'M REALLY WONDERING IS: I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not. I want to ask a professional but, I can't tell my mom... so, I came here to ask if anyone knows what this could mean.

"I've got my date set and all, but it can't come soon enough. I didn't anticipate looking forward to it, but I genuinely can't wait. When I first set it, I frequently became nauseous and dizzy thinking about my impending mortality, but as I get closer and closer to the day, the less worried and more ready I feel. It's becoming difficult not to discuss it with others or bring it up during conversations, especially because it's on my mind 24/7, it's the most remarkable thing that will happen to me probably ever. This probably sounds like an egotistical rant ""I, I, I, me, me, me"", but I do not care, for too long my life has been dictated by other people and factors out of my control and in my last 15 days, I'm gonna fucking focus on myself, nobody and nothing else matters to me now (when have I ever mattered to them?)",No,"1.

"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up.

"I‚Äôm so sick of this. I have a big nose, big forehead, big everything and it‚Äôs so hard to deal with. People have told me they didnt date me because I‚Äôm ugly. People have even told me I‚Äôm too ugly to go after. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve been in my fair share of relationships, but I‚Äôve been rejected so many times just for being ugly and I‚Äôm sick of it. I am soon to leave home for college and before that I want to get a nose job to make me more confident before I leave, but none of the 758394858 retail jobs I‚Äôve applied to got back to me. It‚Äôs like the world wants me to be this way. I‚Äôm not believing that looks don‚Äôt matter bs. I just want to look good, and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm suicidal because of it.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

"Hi! I was previously on 80 mg of Prozac and it helped a little with regulating my mood, but then I think my anxiety got worse because I started having trouble staying asleep and my problems with concentration got even worse.

"So... I've wanted to kill myself for the longest. I've even made several failed attempts. I've prayed to God for death. For Him to take me in my sleep. And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being... When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy. I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again... I just want to be happy, man.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise. It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together. So I'm going to.

"I'm a dude, almost 19 years old, and I live with my parents. I don't work, I've quit college right after joining ( this past fall ) and I very rarely get out of the house. I spend my time playing video games and watching youtube videos. I frequently ask myself what would happen if my parents kicked me out, if I truly was alone and had to fend for myself. Am I just a spoiled lazy kid, or is what I'm claiming real. I DO feel shitty sometimes, but I'm in a sort of hibernation the rest of the time if that makes any sense. I DO remember having real issues with anxiety, finding it incredibly hard to talk to people at times but right now it doesn't really feel like anything. I have a couple of really good friends but I don't really like hanging out with them anymore. I've just sort of accepted where I'm at right now.

I want to know for sure that I'm not just making shit up and what I feel is real but I'm not sleeping 19 hours a day, I'm not a junkie and I haven't attempted suicide.

"tonight something strange happened. i was out with friends, we drank a little (i had about 3 drinks in 3-4 hrs) and when we left, we decided we‚Äôd go to the closest friends‚Äô house and continue to drink. i was by no means wasted. out of no where my chest began to tighten and my heart started racing. at the last second, i asked to be dropped off at my parents‚Äô. i told my mom what happened and she suggested that it was an asthma attack. I‚Äôve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath) it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can‚Äôt get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it‚Äôs vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i‚Äôm going to do in the future, a job, etc. the whole episode lasted half an hour or so. i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this?? any help is appreciated :) add on: the feeling is similar to as if someone were holding my heart and lungs in their hands, and slowly tightening their grip. not sure if that makes sense but it‚Äôs the best way i can think to describe it",No,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post**: The post does not explicitly mention feelings of disconnection or isolation from others.

However, there are no specific cues that detail recurring experiences of exclusion or rejection from social groups, which would be integral to confirming thwarted belongingness.

"My close friend told me, get help. Get help. Get help. And how I could be bringing others down by even venting, so I stopped. But the last thing I want to do is talk to a stranger about my feelings or not wanting to go on, feeling hopeless, and just fed up. Because I refuse to take medication or be ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù and the only other person who understands is my friend, who is also suicidal.

"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression... I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed. Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why. So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression. So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not. I wanted to do a couple things 1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel 2 I wanted to start publishing my art 3 I wanted to start animating I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me. YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily. Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

"My girlfriend is depressed and is trying really hard not to be. School, work, and family problems were a bit much and I believe she just got overwhelmed and got pulled down.

"The notes that we exchanged during my last few days at that high school, as well as the hug that you gave to say goodbye and farewell stayed with me.

Perhaps I misunderstood what you were trying to tell me. I can't speak or think for you. So when I wrote you a message telling you how I felt, you read it, and you never replied back, deleted me, dropped me; completely eradicating my existence a year after I left, I still held that note. Did you hold mine? I would appreciate a response from you, even if it's this late in time. I just want to hear it from you. Why you spent time with me, and why you wrote me that letter. What was the use of being my ""friend""? I told myself I'd burn this note that you gave me once I've become happier.

I hope you don't mind me. For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention.

It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity.

Specific phrases like I decided not to go with them out to dinner and I have no one to talk to right now emphasize a sense of isolation and disengagement from social interactions.

2. **Evaluate the tone of the post**: The tone is overwhelmingly one of sadness and loneliness. Phrases such as I've hated myself my whole life, I can't stop crying, and wishing I wasn't forced into this world convey deep emotional pain and highlight feelings of exclusion and hopelessness, reinforcing the impression of Thwarted Belongingness.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: The author mentions having been psychologically abused and refers to a long history of mental health struggles dating back to childhood. This suggests a pattern of negative experiences related to safety, acceptance, and support, all contributing to feelings of rejection and exclusion over time.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: Each clue presented—the decision to isolate oneself from friends, feelings of self-hatred, a history of abuse, and expressing a desire for connection during a time when the author feels particularly vulnerable—supports the conclusion that there is a significant sense of Thwarted Belongingness present in the post. The emotional distress and lack of social connection are consistent with this concept."

"So that I could see exactly why I'm so repulsive. I have no idea what it is. I used to just tell myself it's because I'm not super attractive but now I'm getting paranoid I drive people away with some shitty aura that is completely out of my control. This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree. I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway. I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer. I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden.

"Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center.

"I wish it would go away. My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope. Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless. Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control. I had no choice in my existence. Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for. I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events. How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me? I guess I'll try to answer for myself. I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose. Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough. I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess. I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard. Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first. As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate. The real struggle is to create something more. I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree. I can just end the suffering, the pain, the world, MY world, at any time.

"EDIT: I was in a bad mood, mostly frustrated as the songs I made in the period of 2 weeks I was created hadn't struck a chord with me, but since the responses i've gotten i've since got a new perspective on it.

"I am not much of a people person, more often than not I am forgotten. People don't gravitate towards me, rather, they tend to stay away. I try to be sociable, and pleasant, and kind, but it doesn't seem to matter. People have already made up their minds about me, which is sad, but true. Some people are just born with it, I guess. No one wants me in his/her life, there are far better people out there. People who can sustain a conversation, and be confident and lively. I am not that person, I used to be, but not anymore. That part of me is gone, and I don't see it coming back. I fill my time now with other pursuits, mainly writing and creating videos, neither of which are good. My writing is terrible and my videos make no sense. Hell, I tried to make a serious video today, but had to play it off like a comedy because it was downright awful. I can't even vocalize my feelings properly, nor have anyone truly listen to what I have to say. There is no point in trying anymore, I feel like giving up. There is a strange sense of calm to that realization, and it feels more comforting than it should. I wish it could be different, but sadly, there is no other way.

However, the latter part of the post introduces a sense of hope and eagerness for the future, which alters the tone but does not negate earlier feelings of thwarted belonging.

3. **Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings**: There is no explicit mention of being ignored or rejected by others; however, the internal conflict expressed suggests a struggle with personal emotional connections. The mention of hardships indicates a history of distress that may contribute to feelings of being out of place.

4. **Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness**: While the post expresses a journey from suffering to empowerment, the initial emotions of sadness and dissatisfaction within the context of a relationship indicate periods of thwarted belongingness.

Thus, the evidence suggests that there were phases where the individual experienced feelings of isolation and disconnection before finding a renewed sense of hope."

I grieve myself, so I can understand. But he cannot. He thinks I'm just being selfish, lazy, mean, etc. I looked on Google for some ideas but didn't find anything that I felt like going with.

And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point. &amp;nbsp; Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed. You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy. For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option. I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless. &amp;nbsp; I want to be a whole person. I'm not motivated. There's nothing I really want from life. &amp;nbsp; ""I took the medicine, but the pills don't work, the pills they don't do anything, but rearrange all the littlest things.""

Best part about the winter is that the water is so cold here. I‚Äôve thought about jumping in and never coming back. I‚Äôve thought about this probably at least once a day since it got cold out.

"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this.

"Hi guys, I might need some help. I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle.

My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them. I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.).

It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression.

"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less.

"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good.

I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout... This class is just so damn far out of my comfort zone.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world.

Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room. However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well.

"So like many of us, I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation , and it was incredible. It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person. Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it, thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds. Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. Went back to the doctor. We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes. I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also. i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do. i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years. I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa. but i've not been able to find it. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me? what is the next step? any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next?",No,"1. **Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging**: The post reflects a sense of struggle with mental health by stating phrases like suffered from anxiety and depression, pretty severe depression, getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do, and struggling finding the right meds.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug?

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore. I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy. I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass. Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life.

But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me.

"22m. I take treatment for anxiety and depression. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs helping or not, because some days, both before and after starting the SSRI, I feel normal and friendly, others I feel angry and unable to have a conversation with anyone because I fear talking to other people so much, and also because the thoughts and images in my head are racing so fast I cannot slow them down fast enough to collect a thought to speak.

"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know. This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place. This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb. The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive). I've no idea what to do anymore. Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for). I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse. It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static. People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person.

"2017 was rough.

The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone. 2017 my friends left me high and dry 2018 they're not gonna be able to",Yes,"1.

"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now?

He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him. When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing. Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently. It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

I feel like I‚Äôm not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable.

And I‚Äôm at a point where my anxiety that comes with it is so bad that I would rather not do my homework and get yelled at than even think about it. I‚Äôve never told anyone I‚Äôm depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends. I‚Äôve never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I‚Äôm 14 now and that‚Äôs my theory.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done.

"I've been through some rough times now, just entered college and couldn't talk to anyone for a while... Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain. I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now.

It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog.

"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave. I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all. This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends.

"For the record, I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself or try to gather sympathy but I'm done. All my life I've let people walk all over, I've always put everyone else before myself, and I've gone above beyond for people. I don't know why people don't like me or be around me. I have gone to therapy for years to better myself and always tried to be the best person I can but it didn't work. I hate myself so much. I am a burden to my parents, very few people care about me and I am a waste of space to be alive. I know my parents will be upset but they will get over it quickly because they have my brother who is extremely intelligent, handsome and very well-liked. My dad will for sure be okay because he had two kids from a previous marriage and one's a doctor about to get engaged and the other owns her marketing agency and is married to a great guy with two beautiful children. I come from a family of overachievers and I have never measured no matter how hard I tried. They are also very attractive people and for some reason, I came out looking so deformed and ugly. I just feel like there is no point in trying anymore. I screw up all the time, I am a huge loser and very few people like me. It's better I do this now than waste another 25 years alone.

"I see the brick walls where I used to see beauty. Eating no longer feels pleasurable. My hobbies make me agitated. My friends make me anxious. The only part of my brain that still works is the fear response. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can keep going. I grew up being taught to do the right thing‚Äîand I know continuing on is the right thing‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt realize how much human sanity relied on positive emotions. We are not guided by instinct‚Äîwe are guided by these emotions. Mine are directing me towards death, and I wonder why, in the most advanced on minds, this pathway exists (suicide is unique to humans even though animals kill themselves).

"I've kind of turned into a serial crusher due to my crippling loneliness.

In the back of my mind I know that I could replace this person with essentially anyone and I would still feel the same, but I'm just fixated on this one person.

"1. ""You just have to wait for the right time. Stop trying. You're still young. You'll find the right person eventually."" This is literally just you pushing the problem off onto whoever I'm with the next time I'm having a bad day. And not everyone does fall in love. I find it more likely I'll be dead before that ever happens. 2. ""You have to love yourself before anyone else will love you."" Then I guess I'm fucked. I don't love me. I despise me. So does everyone else. That's why I'm here. 3. ""Being in a relationship won't fix your depression."" No shit.

And this shit is just wearing me down. I really don't want to live anymore. I have nothing to live for anymore...no friends/relationships, not good at anything, don't really have hobbies, just nothing. I really wish I had just offed myself when I had the chance...now I'm going to have to find a new way out.

"Whatsup... I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode. For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it. But, is it safe to say that people without a genetic predisposition to depression's brains function (from birth) as a depressed person would function while on medication?",No,"1. Identify explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging in the post: The author describes themselves as having always been a dark/unlively person and mentions feelings that are primarily rooted in nostalgia and excitement, indicating a disconnect from more present or vibrant emotional experiences.

3. Consider contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings: The author states they have been happy at certain points in life, yet always feel a presence of that filter, suggesting a recurring theme of experiencing joy overshadowed by persistent darker feelings. This implies a pattern of internal conflict and an inability to fully connect with positive experiences, which can be indicative of a thwarted sense of belonging.

4. Verify whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness: The overall tone of sadness, combined with the frequent reflections on darkness and disconnection, align well with Thwarted Belongingness.

"Hi, I am no stranger to depression my self but am having a lot of current difficulties with helping my wife through hers. As I'm sure your all know what works for one person may not work for the next. Nor is it easy to know exactly what will help the best, especially when the depression hinders the sufferer from understanding their own needs, being able to express them and sometimes even not being able to accept the help even if it is exactly what they were asking for.

"It seems petty that I have to post on a forum to announce my own suicide, and not to mention that if I really wanted to die, I wouldn't be attention-whoring myself, but I would at least want to say goodbye to this world that I've lived in as a respectable leave-off, almost like a resignation letter in a job, even if it was just a single post on the internet.

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications? The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise. Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.

I don‚Äôt enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I‚Äôve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The bias stopped when I started fighting back. They are also very controlling my mom is always on my back always hovering over me and I‚Äôm kinda annoyed by her she treats me like a little boy and like I can‚Äôt do nothing for myself. They limit me and I don‚Äôt wanna be around them.,No,"1. Identifying explicit expressions of disconnection, isolation, or lack of belonging:
   - The post contains phrases such as I hate being around my family, I don’t even talk to them, and I don’t enjoy their company. These clearly indicate a desire for distance and a lack of connection with family members.

2. Evaluating the tone of the post:
   - The tone expresses feelings of unease, irritation, and annoyance. Phrases like get uneasy, start to get irritated, and always hovering over me contribute to an overall sense of frustration and loneliness, reinforcing the impression of Thwarted Belongingness. 

3. Considering contextual clues indicating repeated patterns of such feelings:
   - The post mentions a history of abuse (alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive) and controlling behaviors, which suggests a long-term pattern of feeling disconnected and rejected. The reference to past abuse signifies a lack of emotional safety and belonging within the family dynamic.

4. Verifying whether the evidence aligns consistently with the concept of Thwarted Belongingness:
   - Every clue identified—feelings of hatred towards family interactions, unease in communication, historical abuse, and controlling family behaviors—supports the conclusion of Thwarted Belongingness. The individual expresses a consistent theme of disconnection from his family, which aligns with the concept."
