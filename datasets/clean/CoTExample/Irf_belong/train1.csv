"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9. The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out. I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

"I always feared people's judgement. I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider. I always kept to myself. No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either.

"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger.

When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it?

At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then. Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf.

"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like, well, what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things. Is there a way to just power through life?

"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been biasdv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing.

My car wouldn't start, my bathtub is overflowing, it's cold as fuck right now, and I've quit cigarettes, so I can't blow steam off that way.

"I know everyone technically does. I‚Äôm trans, gay, a person of color, mentally ill, and I feel like I‚Äôm living on borrowed time. My body and head keeps fighting against me as things get externally better, comparatively. I‚Äôve been having blood problems - or maybe just extra health anxiety, I genuinely do not know.

"I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself.

I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that.

"A crisp white coating engulfed the road at 5am. Another sleepless night, another crunchy step taken on the path to escape. It's like a deathbed, cold yet in a way comforting. The dimly lit roads winding through the hills all seemingly leading nowhere but in an endless circle. A cruel metaphor of life.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care.

I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours).

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to.

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy.

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now.

"I‚Äôve been suffering from depression and anxiety since like 8th grade.

I thought I‚Äôve been getting better but realized that I‚Äôm actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people.

I‚Äôm so fucking sick of this you‚Äôd think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don‚Äôt like me and I don‚Äôt blame them.

I just started last semester and I‚Äôve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague.

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down.

I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression.

"Perpetually asked if you're ok and always respond with "" I'm fine "". It's pathetic I know, but I always just want someone to reach out and just know that I'm not fine. Obviously, this will never happen... but I have too much pride to ever tell someone I need help. I can't tell my parents because I fear their judgment.

But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. I‚Äôm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation.

"It's been a crappy winter so far. Found out I'm going to be out of a job at the end of the month and I don't know what else I'm going do do with myself. My car is continuing to fall apart.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight.

"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life.

That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void.

I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life.

"Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night?

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping. Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her.

I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization.

Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out.

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me... I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do.

"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.)

All two of them could break into the library now... There are so many... Finally here... I wait. Nobody. It never was... I was wrong. I have learned nothing.

"I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline. For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

I hope you don't mind me. For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention.

It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity.

"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good.

I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout... This class is just so damn far out of my comfort zone.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac.

"So like many of us, I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation , and it was incredible. It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person.

We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes. I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also. i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do. i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years. I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa. but i've not been able to find it. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me? what is the next step? any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next?",No,"1.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug?

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed.

It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass. Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life.

It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that.

Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".

"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school.

I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time.

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done.

"I've been through some rough times now, just entered college and couldn't talk to anyone for a while...

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation).

"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive.

My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.
