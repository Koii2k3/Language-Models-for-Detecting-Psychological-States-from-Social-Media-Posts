The post directly mentions want die and strongly considering, which express suicidal thoughts. There is also a reference to depression and feelings of wanting to hurt, which can be associated with self-harm.

2. The tone of the language suggests significant distress. Phrases such as really exploded last 2 3 year indicate overwhelming emotions, and terms like sad and cannot agree imply a lack of purpose and resolve in facing the challenges described.

3. Contextually, the mention of dealing mental health issue since wa kid and the escalation over the past 2 3 year suggests a long history of difficulties, possibly indicating chronic distress. The reference to seeking help by calling a hotline and being transferred shows some level of social isolation and a lack of support.

4. There are signs of help-seeking behavior in the post; the individual called a hotline and expressed a desire for help, despite the challenging response they encountered (sassy lady told option). This indicates an openness to discussing their mental health challenges and a need for support.

5. The language used reflects a high level of urgency and severity. Phrases like want die and strongly considering emphasize a critical state of mind. The overall tone conveys desperation and an intense struggle with feelings of hopelessness.

6. In summary, the key points indicating the presence of suicidal intent include: direct mentions of wanting to die, expressions of severe distress and hopelessness, a long history of mental health issues, attempts to seek help from a hotline, and a tone reflective of urgency and desperation. These elements collectively underscore a significant risk of suicidal thoughts and intentions."

3. **Look for contextual indicators, such as mentions of recent traumatic events, social isolation, or loss of support**: The individual describes a rough home life with conflicts with their parents, experiences of physical harm (e.g., being made to bleed), and social isolation from friends. They feel trapped in their situation with a lack of support from their family and describe an inability to enjoy life, indicating significant environmental stressors.

4. **Analyze if there are any signs of help-seeking behavior, such as asking for advice, expressing a desire to talk, or seeking support**: There is an indication of seeking support when the individual mentions wanting to talk to a friend and hints at desires for a life change (wanting to live in the city and pursue a different career). However, there is overwhelming language about feeling like a loser and not having anyone to talk to at home, suggesting a lack of effective support.

5. **Consider the frequency and intensity of the language used. Determine if the expressions suggest a heightened level of urgency or severity**: The repeated expressions of wanting to kill, feeling insane, and describing their current existence as torturous demonstrate a high intensity and urgency regarding their mental state. The combination of despair and a sense of being trapped indicates a significant level of severity.
