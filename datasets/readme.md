# Dataset Overview

This repository contains the datasets used in our research, referencing the main raw datasets from [SteveKGYang/MentalLLaMA](https://github.com/SteveKGYang/MentalLLaMA?tab=readme-ov-file).

The repository is organized into two subfolders:

## 1. `clean`

This folder houses the cleaned and preprocessed datasets prepared for our research.  The data within this folder is ready for immediate use.

*   **`CoTExample`:**  Contains examples of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts employed in our research. This folder includes 2 files:

    *   `generate_cot_example.py` - includes the prompts used to generate the CoT examples.
    *   `gpt_generate_cot_reason.py` - main script to generate the CoT examples.

    The figure below illustrates the pipeline for generating CoT examples.

## 2. `raw`

This folder contains the original, unprocessed datasets downloaded directly from their respective sources.  See below for links to the original datasets and associated papers.
