"He said he had not felt that way before, suggeted I go rest and so ..TRIGGER AHEAD IF YOUI'RE A HYPOCONDRIAC LIKE ME: i decide to look up ""feelings of doom"" in hopes of maybe getting sucked into some rabbit hole of ludicrous conspiracy, a stupid ""are you psychic"" test or new age b.s., something I could even laugh at down the road. No, I ended up reading that this sense of doom can be indicative of various health ailments; one of which I am prone to.. So on top of my ""doom"" to my gloom..I am now f'n worried about my heart. I do happen to have a physical in 48 hours.",1
"Hey there r/assistance, Not sure if this is the right place to post this.. but here goes =) I'm currently a student intern at Sandia National Labs and working on a survey to help improve our marketing outreach efforts at the many schools we recruit at around the country. We're looking for current undergrad/grad STEM students so if you're a STEM student or know STEM students, I would greatly appreciate if you can help take or pass along this short survey.

"My mom then hit me with the newspaper and it shocked me that she would do this, she knows I don't like play hitting, smacking, striking, hitting or violence of any sort on my person. Do I send out this vibe asking for it from the universe? Then yesterday I decided to take my friend to go help another ""friend"" move to a new place. While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like ""you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention"" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.",1
"until i met my new boyfriend, he is amazing, he is kind, he is sweet, he is a good student, he likes the same things as me, my family likes him, and so on... but i dont feel that passion that rush i felt with my ex, the truth is that when i started going out with my boyfriend i secretly saw my ex a few times to see if i really didnt feel nothing for him, but it was disgusting, i didnt even want him to touch me, i feel bad with myself i didnt want him, but still, i was there. then i kinda realized i felt nothing love related for him and it was ok, HE was HURT when he knew i was dating this boy and he even begged me to stay but of course not. but now the problem is that when im with my boyfriend i dont feel like i love him, like that thing you kinda have to feel with a new love, i just feel ""ok"" with him, and i catch myself thinking about my ex from time to time, remembering all the good things we had and it drives me crazy because i know that if i see him again i wont feel that way, that ""love"" that my mind makes me think stills there. and recently i found out that he has a girl and he is actually enjoying the experience and i got so mad and so hurt (i know i dont have any right to feel that way) i felt betrayed and I STILL feel that way, i gross myself out.",1
"October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and I am a domestic violence survivor who is still struggling, even after over four years. Lately I have been feeling very angry. Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions. This man abused me in all manners: physically, sexually, emotionally, verbally, financially, etc. I was granted a restraining order against him (and it was renewed a year later) but I was unable to press criminal charges against him because I didn’t have enough evidence to have a case.",1
"I think he doesn't want to put in the effort for the relationship to work (and we're both so difficult that we have to work on our relationships, doesn't matter with whom) but he can't be without me either. What should I do? I'm afraid this is gonna happen over and over again, because I'm always forgiving him at some point. Am I being strung along? TL;DR: Boyfriend [28,M] broke up with me [23,F] after on-off for 1.5 years, I thought we just got it together and am devastated...don't know what to do, want to keep fighting but should I?",1
"It was a big company so luckily I didn't have to see him all the time, but when I did, he again acted as though I didn't exist. I tried to talk to him and update him on the pregnancy, and ask him to be involved for our child's sake, and he literally stared right through me without saying a word. 3 months after our daughter was born, I texted him and told him he was missing out on the most amazing person in this world, and how it wasn't fair to her. To my surprise, he wrote back and wanted to see her. He apologized, said he had changed and within a couple of months, we were engaged.",0
  It cleared up and I was okay but. On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did. That night was bad just like last time.   Also yesterday my sleep was bad I woke up like every hour of the night just like last time. I got kind of scared like I did last time but this time I think that this is fake life which is absurd but I just think about it then get really scared then I think rationally then calm down.,1
"I actually give an assistant half my emergency fee to come help me sometimes. I feel unsafe driving to ""house calls"" in the middle of the night by myself. I frequently bring my husband along as a makeshift “tech” or when I feel unsafe, which is obviously unfair to him. Unhappy Husband: My husband is miserable both with his 60 minute commute and with our isolation out here in the country. We feel like we have no social life out here.",1
"I just feel like the street life has fucked my head up. There's so much I don't even know how to talk about anymore, I just hold that shit. Only person I can really chat with is a pal I know at the bar. He has PTSD and shit from the military bad, hard up alcoholic nowadays after killing people.. We talk once every few weeks and we are open and it's cool. But normal people?",1
"Next week I’ll be flying for our family vacation. The flights won’t be very long (just MSY to LAS then LAX to MSY on the way home), but flying really triggers my anxiety. Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings, so the idea of being in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air is not ideal for me. I also have a lot of fears about terrorist attacks/mass shootings (movie theaters and other crowded public places are also a problem for me). I was wondering if anyone has any tips for flying anxiety/fear.",1
"Everything sets me off and I'm almost having a panic attack. I'm going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I'm afraid that I'm not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really isn't happy when I do that. Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I've never raised my voice at her even when frustrated. When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily. I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.",1
"I’ve been taking 12.5 mgs zoloft for about 6 months (yeah, super small dose .. but it was taking the edge off, i think). I decided to stop taking it for a few days to see if it was really helping. Now, about 40 hours since my last dose, I’m suddenly kind of shaky and also flushed (my cheeks are burning for no reason. And THOSE side effects are about to freak me out - do you think it is from my missed dose? Is it possible to have such a fast reaction?",1
"No place in my city has shelter space for us, and I won't put my baby on the literal street. (I've been there before. Fine for new, but I don't want to have to go through that with a baby). What cities have good shelter programs for homeless mothers and children? I'd love to be able to make some calls and get on a greyhound between the 7th and 16th (when I'll likely be able to get the money to go).",1
These past couple of months have been the worst. My anxiety has gotten so bad it’s effecting my sleep and relationship. I’ve become so paranoid about my health as well. I don’t feel like me anymore and I just feel scared all the time now over every little thing. I don’t have money to see a therapist either...,1
"I asked him three time what happened. And after the third time I cried and went home. Month later he still don't talk to me and he and my mother started fighting for the first time in the relationship. Me and my mother honestly don't know what to do, he just ignores me. I even told him that I don't date that guy(even though I date him) and he didn't even react to it.",1
"The sensation lasted hours. It seemed like a circulation problem, and I panicked and of course ended up in the ER again. This time a doctor came to see me immediately. He wanted to talk about my anxiety. He said he could run some more tests, but he didn't think it would help.",1
It did hurt but didn’t leave any marks. When I lied down I kept coughing and today it feels kinda constricted like there’s a lump in my throat. I’ve googled and realised how serious it can be and now I’m terrified but scared to go doctor. What do I do I’m not calling police and I am not going to any hospital. I will go to doctor if they are sensitive about it,1

"We had plans to move in together, a fancy $1,800/month home that she would contribute $400 or so. We spoke of children, marriage, all sorts of stuff. It's not that I thought she owed me anything for me doing these things. It's just that I felt like I did so incredibly much and it kills me that I look back and know that over a 5 month period, we only had intimate contact less than 15 times, that we never made out, outside sex (and I initiated and was rejected many, many times). Every time I brought up my frustrations regarding my unmet romantic needs, she took it as gaslighting and used it as fuel to further drive the reason why she wasn't comfortable with intimate contact.",0
"he still holds me back in life. he still finds ways to get to me. YET I STILL TALK TO HIM. and i always feel worse after i do. i've tried blocking him on social media, but he still finds ways to get to me.",1
"I was going through a hard time after our breakup (started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist). In the span of the 2.5 years since our breakup I have had other boyfriends and hookups. Some of my hookups happened to be some of his old friends, the most recent happening 11 months ago. I never talked to these guys leading up to the hook ups or since, it was purely just spur of the moment drunk sex. Recently me and my ex have reconnected after 2.5 years of no contact.",0
"Through work I have been in some dodgy situations abroad. A number of times my life has been at risk, and I've had to defend myself a few times. I'm a civilian and have only had basic weapon training. &#x200B; We've always had an ex-military security contractor with us, but still had to perform aggressive roles when approached.",1
"With a switch blade and open arms In a sweater vest that covers a ragged undershirt stained with my innocence Through faces that are never the same as the ones I dread finding in the crowd In the night, I rediscover my love of mares and how hoarse I can be in the morning It's the taste of blood but I am not bleeding",0
"According to [a study from <url> and its subjects, major risk factors were family problems and a child’s lack of confidence. These factors aren’t necessarily easy to influence but well worth looking into. As is another avenue that we should focus on more: Support for survivors of sexual abuse. Availability and quality of mental health care comes to mind, but it’s not solely limited to the medical field. If we want abusers to be held accountable, we have to help victims because they might not come forward otherwise.",0
"If anything goes wrong, sexually, I want to cease to exist, and a lot of the time, I'm not able to do it out of sheer anxiety. I used to be a very soft person, and I hope I'm still kind, but now I'm quicker to anger, and I don't want to become an abuser. Basically... was I abused? Does that sound like something an abused person would say? I feel like I have the symptoms of PTSD.",1
"I really don’t know what to do about this, and I’m wondering if I’m even able to get over this fear. A traumatic experience compounded it in me as a kid, and I’ve been experiencing it for so long that it feels like second nature. It’s lkkely so ingrained with me that therapy won’t do much good. I need some help. If anyone can offer some, feel free.",1
"November has been one of the worst months in a long time. My mom was in a car accident and has no idea how she's getting to work. A few days later my grandmother died and I didn't even have enough money to attend the funeral. I drove home to be with my family, and to drive my mom 5 hours to the airport. I spent a ton on gas and now money is tight.",1
"Okay, So in since October have just got out of an eight year relationship . We were engaged to get married next year, but it did not work out. It ended mutually and we have moved on. In life these things happen. Since Halloween I have been seeing this Girl.",0
Also the headaches. LOADS of headaches all the time. I’m so done. I hate this almost as bad as my brain constantly telling me I’m a POS. Anxiety is fun :),1
"I'm just blown away by this doctor's willingness to help. I feel so validated every time I leave his office, like someone actually understands what I'm struggling with, and I don't have to convince them of my mental illness. Bottom line? Research docs if you can online, read their reviews and don't give up until you find someone who treats you the way you deserve. If I can do this, I promise you can!",0
I feel like I'm trying to reason my situation though. I'm listing off things that a person would associate success with but I'm not seeing the things I'm failing at. Or maybe I do and the Navy is just exaggerating the things they want out of me? I feel like the Navy is easy and I don't put a lot of time towards it \( I mean qualifications\). When I'm at work I feel like I really  focus in on a task.,0
I am really feeling like there are no good men. They are all just horrible to women. I think I would rather be alone than deal with any man again. Has anyone else felt like this? Did your feelings ever change?,1
"You can see the detail on my [update 2 right <url> and here's a link to the [project github <url> So I'm begging you here, literally begging you. If there's anyone out there who would be kind enough to give me a second chance to fix my fuck up and finish my degree, would you please consider giving me some financial aid via [my goFundMe <url> I'm literally in dire need of help right here and I don't know where else to turn other than the people of the internet :( ***Kind regards,",1
"Did I mention my parents are religious? I don't know if this is normal for religious people to treat. Whenever I tell them I'm terrified of being homeless they tell me I'm a ""acting like a baby"" and ""get over it"" my parents parents did not treat them this way. They're basically mad because they(I guess 30 or 40 years ago were different when they were my age? Because they said they both lived on their own at 17 and that they find it creepy I'm 16+ and they find it creepy being around me).",1
You are being invited to participate in a research study for Heather Cornett’s dissertation at Texas Woman’s University. The purpose of the current study is to examine the role of self-advocacy in those with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) and how it relates to self-stigma and life satisfaction. The research is intended to supply the researcher with information about strategies that could improve life satisfaction in individuals diagnosed with an SPMI. Completion time for the survey is approximately 15-25 minutes. Participants are only allowed to participate once in the current study.,0
"This was a “nice thought”, and even though I had been told my mother to never leave a drink at the bar, it didn’t cross my mind that there might be something put in this drink or that I was being pushed to be more intoxicated. After I started sipping on that drink, I felt all the alcohol hit me and felt drunk. He said I’ve ordered an uber for us, which I thought I was being dropped back at home; I don’t actually remember the ride home in the Uber. We pulled up at his apartment complex, and he said come inside I know you’re hungry I have pizza. I thought eating pizza would be a good idea after the alcohol, so I followed him inside.",0
"But it's been 2 monthsalready this time. We didn't speak for Christmas or new year. I'm lonely, sad, angry at the situation (not angry at him!) and the worst part is not being able to talk or even know what's going on. We didn't fight before this so he's not angry at me.",1
"Sorry this going to be super long, I have a lot to say... Tl;dr... see title. It was constant up and down; one minute we were happy and he was being more affectionate than he has in years, the next he's screaming at me and calling me a whore. I get it, I broke him. I feel so disgusted and ashamed with myself but I truly want to spend my life with no one else.",1
"She was seventeen and they met in a hospital, he was in the drug rehab, she was in the mental hospital. She was 17, and he technically kidnapped her, running across the country. She immediately got pregnant with me, and he married her, at which point the law washed their hands of the matter. I was born premature, 5 months and 3 weeks, which in 1981 was very dangerous. I spent 8 months in an incubator, and had heart surgery, but lived, and have not had health problems.",0
"And it makes me more anxious which causes me to slip up *more*. It's getting WORSE though. I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit. She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck... I know they noticed.",1
"but I'm really, really afraid of public embarrassments and awkward situations. So I was in the train station and saw this homeless lady asking for food and money. I always help homeless people if I have change in my wallet. I walked up to her, took out my wallet and pulled out this £5 cash to give her. She was kinda old, so she wasn't in a perfect physical health.",0
"Our dog Jett has been diagnosed with diabetes and is now in the hospital to stabilize his blood sugar. Luckily, he seems to be doing well and he will be home with us soon. Unfortunately, his bill is large enough that we just can't cover it on our own (especially with our poor financial situation). We're being evicted from our home soon and trying to find a place with this bill is just too much for us by ourselves. [To help us with the bill, we set up a GoFundMe <url>",1
- Specificphobia: most commom type. It's when something causes exarcebate fear in the person. DSM-5 moved two more disorders to a specific group. But it is anxiety disorders: - TOC and post-traumatic stress.,0
"I didn't do anything during spring break, except maybe go to work. And even then, I missed a day because I just couldn't deal with the stress. Most adults get excited to tell you they did absolutely nothing during their break. And there was a time when I enjoyed taking a break too. But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.",1
"I run <url>, which seeks to tell the honest stories of people across the country in order to foster a greater understanding of one another and increase empathy.

"I feel like I will never trust my own judgement again. 3) I fucking HATE being this person. I hate being a victim. I would never judge anyone else in my situation, but I can’t stand having to see myself as someone who was abused.

"I'm pretty healthy and have a silcock key for water but surviving the heat goes beyond just staying hydrated. Not enough food or the salt that comes with it led to bad cramps most mornings.

"I just got out of a four year, mostly on but sometimes off relationship. The last interaction we had, he was moving out. The night before, he had strangled me. We've had a toxic relationship, but mostly loving. He truly tried to love me as much as possible, but would get drunk and be verbally abusive.",0
"Hey everyone. I need a place to vent and place my feelings because I don't know what to do anymore. This evening while playing a boardgame with my BF and some friends, I found out my BF lied big time. Short: last year we decided that I would join him this year on his skiing trip with his friends (his idea). This wasn't possible in the end (or so he told me) because his friends didn't want to rent a cabin but go on a cheap student skiing trip.",1
I’ve been leaving lights on at night both in the main rooms and my bedroom. The fear is both physical and emotional. I’m so jumpy at work and at home. I feel like I’m seeing things everywhere and little waves of panic wash through me all day. I’m really just finding this incredibly difficult right now and needed to write it out I guess.,1
"All of these things I think contributed to this being a less traumatic experience than the first birth. Just before the second birth, she kind of lunged towards our first kid in the road, which, we later learned, gave her symphysis pubis dysfunction <url> She actually had substantial back/neck/joint pain (more on this later) in the first pregnancy as well, and this was worse, causing her to need crutches for the remainder of the pregnancy. This is not a super uncommon thing for a woman to experience <url> which includes my favorite-ever Wikipedia “For [alternate related article], see...”), but for most women, it resolves itself quickly after the baby is born. For my spouse, it didn’t, and she started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. This maybe helped, maybe didn’t.",0

"She was already against smoking weed after college at first but now she seems to have moved to a stance where she's okay with me smoking weed as long as she's there when it happens, as in I could smoke with just her or when we're both hanging out with the same friends. I've tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she can't seem to describe it rationally, saying that it's a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her. I don't know how to explain this to her. I don't want to give up the option of smoking weed with friends but I don't want to break up with her over something like this because I love her.",1
"During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms. Overall we’ve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.",0

"And I don't ask for the nightmares to drain me of all energy and make me feel worse throughout the day the harder I try to be normal.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.",1

I been there for a month but im still very nervous around my peers and teachers. I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet  seem more at ease with other people.",1

So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company.

"When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.",1

Any tips for making more friends? Tl;dr: I've had very few friends throughout my life. Recently I've tried reaching out to a lot of people but almost all of them will decline my offer to hang out at some point. I guess maybe this has to do with how I am socially awkward in the past but I've also been told that I am trying too hard. Any tips for making more friends?,1
i remember her getting drunk and and ranting about a fuck buddy she was angry at. she came up with the brilliant idea of throwing a brick with a pie recipe tied to it through his window (i dont know). she told me to drive her to his house so she could do that and i said i didn't think it was a good idea. she told me if i didn't do it she would drunk drive there with my little brothers in the car. i haven't seen her in 6 and a half years.,0
"I think now she feels some of responsibility to help those in need and she gets a lot of gratification from these people who are very thankful to her. On occasion when we go out, we have been approached by these people and I can tell they are very grateful to her. We were at Starbucks while she's studying and the husband/wife she helped offered to buy her coffee, etc ... Lastly, her other dream is to get a house in this very rich neighborhood with houses that cost $2M at the very least. Anyways, enough with the bad, now the good things about her. She is a very loving person which is proven by the fact that everyone loves her at work.",0
"I looked regular for once and it’s been a while to feel that way. I wanted to show who I was today to the world, it was empowering seeing that face I used to be especially when I saw him just a month ago. I left right away to catch any train heading to North Hollywood and eventually arrived at the area of my work interview. I was early but I know I made a mistake without considering how hard it is to panhandle especially when you don’t look it for the part. I had a sign with me and I asked people to spare me a quarter at most but all I got were weird looks.",0
"Hello guys. This is my first post here. Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different. Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable. My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.",1
I'm completely devastated. My cat was just hit and killed by a car. I don't think I'm allowed to bury him in the garden (we rent) and I don't know what to do.

"Any help on how to stop ruminating? I work with some pretty toxic people and I can accept when people are ignorant and generally rude about my PTSD. I get it, some people are just really stupid and ignorant and won't understand how the assault affected me.

How do you distract yourself from ruminating or arguing with people in your head?",1
"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over. Each time I petitioned her to stop, she would become very visible distressed. She spent a lot of time talking about suicide. During the school year, we exchanged letters every day at school that, in retrospect, sounded a lot like love letters from her part, but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point, and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.",1

"After college for about 2 years, I focused on my career and wasn't totally putting myself out there. Now, for the last year, I've actively put myself in the dating pool. It never seemed appealing to hang around in clubs or bars to hopefully pick someone up, so I've mostly stuck to online dating. I was mostly pretty casually looking, and would go on there when the mood struck me or I was speaking to someone I saw potential with. Over the course of the last about 2.5 months, I've been on 3 dates.",0
"I got 6 stitches. My parents love my bf and in fact, my mom and him are so close that they go on walks and go to the movies together. I felt uncomfortable and unwanted by his family. To be fair, I was also a little closed off with them but mainly because I felt so unwanted. I have put on some weight, which I am sure his dad noticed because he absolutely hates fat people.",1
I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things. When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked. Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me.,1
"This sends me into an extreme anxiety spiral, because I'd been seeing his mother almost every weekend for nearly five years, and she does this at the drop of a hat. I understand she was just trying to protect her son, but the level of nastiness was just insane. I had to get our old counsellor - mine and N's - involved to speak to her. She said the mother is taking things seriously. I don't believe it.",1

It's been incredibly hard making ends meet by myself and although I get rent paid, all other bills are stuck on the back burner.

"I was never really close to him, our conversations never went past the 'nice weather we're having' area. But I coincidentally ran into him at a bar recently and I initially tried to keep my distance from him because I know he's friends with Zach, but then he told me that not only does he and Zach are no longer in contact with each other, they actually really dislike each other now. I'm guessing something went down after Zach and I broke up. After that, I was more comfortable around him. So, as the night went along and we got drunker, we ended up hooking up.",0

"I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.",1
"Hi I just wondered if any of you could offer some advice on this situation. I bought a house year ago, but I am yet to move in.

I am currently still at home with my parents.",0
"(Hurt the ego, but whatever, I guess you're not always gonna be the hottest guy she's ever been with.) Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her, because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up, and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",1
"There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy. Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate. Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety. My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.",1
"The simplest breathing technique can help you calm your mind. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. Simply, place your hands on your belly, then ribs, then upper chest and practice breathing into your hands.

By placing my hands on your body, you can choose a certain number of breaths to count and focus on the physical sensation of your hands rising and falling.",0

"Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.",0
"These weren't the only punishments, though. Sometimes he'd make us choose a favorite toy or plushie to be thrown out if we'd made him mad, and one time when he caught me rescuing my plushie, he slapped me across the face, then made me watch him cut her into little pieces, standing there at 1 in the morning berating me about how I was a stupid, ignorant little bitch that needed right and wrong beaten into her, because I was too stupid to to know how to do as I was told. Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry... He'd utterly lose control of himself.

Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have. Going forward keep in mind 2 things:,0
My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up.

Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears. My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.",1
I did. I moved 1300 miles away. I’m in therapy (just started again). Financially I don’t have any worries at the moment. I’m moving to a bigger place ..,0
"I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1
"My current boyfriend wasn't right, just a figure of the coma induced illusion. The only voice that seemed remotely really was my best friend, she's one of the few regular poodle I still have contact from that time. After a hour of my boyfriend, my best friend and my other partner working with me, I slowly started coming to some balanced sembelrnce of reality. Now I'm scared to go back to sleep. My ex, who abused me for 11 years, might be waiting tight there for me again.",1
"Really hoping someone might have some insight for me! A couple years ago I (31,F) befriended one of colleagues (28,M). We were working for a small company that was also hemorrhaging cash, and eventually it was just him, me and some older coworkers in this open space office. Anyway, we really got along! We would have lunches, text in the evenings and weekends, and often go to the pub after work.",0
"I know what it means to dive into oneself. I asked him and he confirmed its a deeper variant. I got excited. There’s no switching out of consciousness, you can reject what he says, your totally in control (or so he’s telling me :)). So the first part was getting me deep, through counting, dropping my hand and other techniques I went deep.",0
"Hi all! I don’t exactly know where to start, but here goes. I have been on my own since 17, as I do not talk to my biological parents or my aunt that took care of me until 17. I went to college this last year in NC, but had to move back and stay with a friend due to low finances. While in college, I suffered from a concussion and mold poisoning from my dorm room.",0
"I know I should tell her my doubts, because I know she's gone through doubts before as well. But I also don't know if now I'm just second guessing because I'm just generally concerned about the future. Above all I just have no idea what to do.   ---   **tl;dr**: living long distance, dealing with chronic wedding anxiety and fear about impact of children, fantasizing about others, and hoping for insight from people who have been through similar experiences.",1
"As for internet, I pay $60/mo on my phone for unlimited talk, text, and data without any throttling at all (thanks StraightTalk)! If I want internet on my laptop, I download the PdaNet+ app, download the .exe app on my phone then transfer to my laptop, install the app, then switch the tethering on so my laptop can connect and have access. That way, I can apply for more jobs on sites that my phone can't open up. So far, I'm doing okay. Just thought I would like to share how's my day been doing.",0
"I felt the tension and the seriousness. Usually during lockdown drills things aren't too serious because we're high schoolers. We mess around because we know nothing is wrong. But this drill was different. We knew we were all okay, that everyone was safe, but the atmosphere was completely different.",0
"I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word. If someone asked me if I was, I'd deny it but I know I have PTSD and I guess that does make me ill by definition. Will I be considered mentally ill forever?",1
"Even moreso with a little push from behind. I've also been interviewing and applying for more secondary jobs to supplement my current employment and that seems to be going increasingly well. Thank you so much again everyone who sent food items to me, I'll be sure to pay it forward someday!

"He has been my best friend since the first day we met, he treats me great, he is always loving, not at all selfish, etc. We rarely fight and have only had maybe 2 other big arguments which we worked out. I am just so hurt over what he said to me. Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said, it’s  not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation.",1
"I would like to leave there, but I'm terrified of a shelter. I'm also a semi observant Jewish woman. Most shelters won't help me keep kosher and keep Shabbat, both of which are important to me. The Rachel Coalition is for domestic violence only, so I can't go there. The NCJW shelter in the area doesn't accept the voucher welfare would offer me.",1
"	It was the summer, I had just started a new job as a bartender.  I met a girl that was equally odd, had a lot of similar interests, was looking for the same thing I was.  We quickly became enamored with each other. It didn't take long for us to move in together.  I started finding projects around the house to fix up, she would surprise me with home cooked meals or a note gushing over our relationship.",0
I’ve always been the type of person who’s been gravitated towards romance. The thought of loving someone and being loved in return was nice but I’m a closed off person who’s too afraid to let someone in. I recently got into a relationship with someone who is really incredible. He’s very patient and understanding about my anxiety and depression. It took a while and a few arguments for me to open up a little bit.,0
"It’s only happened 3/4 times recently but I’ve been putting off having sex and I’m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesn’t think I’m into her or that I’m losing interest, and so on. I’ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety. It’s a vicious circle at the moment. It’s almost as if I can’t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about. What do you guys think?",1
"2. I have health insurance, and I know my insurance website has resources for finding a doctor, but what factors should l look at when going to choose my doctor? I've never done this before, but I think it will definitely help. Please let me know your thoughts! Thank you.",0
One of the couples has a four-year-old daughter. We live in a two bedroom apartment. I constantly have to do shit for these people. One of the wives scolds me  constantly and tells me I need to show more respect for my parents. They leave needles out everywhere and when I inevitably step on one I'll probably end up with an STD.,1
"I hate the thought that even after my mom's death she still has power over me. Anyways, I've come here for advice on meds, specifically if this sounds like a good place to start. I used to just focus on the anxiety and insomnia acutely but never really tried to treat the source. I'm starting Effexor XR, Prazosin for the horrendous nightmares and continuing on clonazepam for panic attacks. Thanks guys!",1
"My father has: Keys to a fancy car, like 5 fancy bikes, an iPad, member of a fitness center, goes to the sauna regularily, other women... Needless to say, they should just break up immediately, right? Well, it should be that simple, but my mother resists for some reason. We had this situation countless times, where she was like, I cannot cope with this anymore, let's find another place to live in, until you find something for yourself, and when things are about to happen, she goes nah, I don't know... Which is so frustrating to hear after a while. Even more so, when he says things like HE decides when or if they split up.",1
"**How can I move to a more mature kind of love that is less focused on me and my fears, and instead more about him and our relationship? **   ---   **tl;dr**: Feeling like I am being selfish and immature, mostly focusing on my needs of distance and validation and less on those of my LDR bf. Worrying about the possibility that we might not like each other that much anymore once we live together for a while.",1
"Hi, I was recently put on Prozac (10mg to start) for anxiety after a really bad panic attack. I am nervous but also hopeful that this will help me. For the first week I cried at least once a day and usually there was no reason, my anxiety is also heightened but I knew these symptoms would occur so I've been dealing with it fine. But for the past like day and a half I feel like my joints are kind of feeling weird. I wouldn't say it's painful just different.",0
"They were late. They tried to play it cool with the excuse they gave, but J had this grin on his face and Lux had the flushes look she gets when she has sex. And then Lux said she was going to fix her hair and left to the bathroom and after a while J said he was going to see if she needed help. Obviously they left to have sex. I mean, fine, but I thought that was a bit disrespectful.",0
PS: I can't get fired because one she is in another department which doesn't break policy and I am in good working and personal relations with my direct boss and the one above him.   ---   **tl;dr**: Started having sex with a co-worker 8 months ago. Found out today that she is married and that some of our sexual partners were also married. What should I do?,1
"and then proceeded to show me the video of the ""dumb girlfriend"" struggling to answer the question. Needless to say, I was pissed. I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?",1

"I also have no family. I was abused for my disabilities as a child, including murder attempts, so I cannot turn to my family for help. I have friends helping me with food and transportation because I am poor and disability aid is barely enough to eat a meal a day. I have food stamps that work for about a week or week and a half of groceries so that's already really helpful. I live in a small, worn down appartement with no heating and thays why I am so cold.",1
"I specifically told my father NOT to lose my money gambling. I'm not that depressed since I sort of expected this to happen, but I am still severely disappointed. I am literally continuing to lose respect for my own father. Of course, it isn't so much the money, but rather that he would do this to me when I told him not to. I fear that if this continues, my father will continue to waste away his own life as well as damage mine.",1
"He came to the door, drunk and high on opiates (he’s an ex H addict, opiate rage is real), he told me, verbatim, that if there was a guy in the house, he’d kill him on the spot, no questions asked.

"I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, I just didn't need it. Long story short, something's flipped in my head the last couple of weeks and my libido is very much back, worryingly so, I'm not sure what to do with it lol. So we've had more sex in the past 7 days than the preceding 7 years....but it's still very much for him. I don't know what I want and I don't know how to ask for what I want. It's been so freaking long since I considered sex as a thing it actually makes me nervous.",1

"Worse than that develop the same anxiety disorder. Again another reason to finish the relationship. I really love her but cannot and WILL NOT embarrass her like I did at the wedding. My plan is to go talk to a private physiatrist and see what they think. I don’t believe medication is the only answer but if it helps in conjunction with therapy, a healthy lifestyle and meditation then I will try it.",1
"I apologized for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a ""retarded"" voice. So, is our relationship doomed?   ---   **tl;dr**: My bf and I fight too much, and I think it's both our faults while he thinks it's only mine/my brain chemistry's fault. Am I crazy, or do we need to break up?",1
"Normally, my anxiety is very well controlled. I meditate every morning for \~15 minutes and have been in therapy for the better part of the last 3 or 4 years. I feel WAY better than I used to, and on a day to day basis things are great. Buttt every once in a while (A handful of times a year, tops) something will realllly set me over the edge, and send me into an intense anxiety spiral where I compulsively ask 5 or so different friends for advice on what to do, post a lot of threads online about what I should do, and ruminate on the topic for days or weeks. Sometimes I'll have chats in messenger about whatever it is that will draw out over an entire 3-4 hour period.",0
"Sure it was almost 3 years ago (in July) two months into my first job out of university. I got bit in the leg and continued on like it was nothing. I only fell apart October 2016.

Hearing those words, I literally felt my chest rip open and haven't been able to close the wound since.",1

What is for you the most relatable portrayal you have seen/heard I don't have PTSD but reading a retired Marines blog I noticed that when he was talking about his PTSD it sounded a lot like Rick in the Walking Dead.

Hey. First time posting here. I have been living in my car with my brother and cat since May. I am feeling extremely depressed/defeated right now hence why I'm posting here. I'll start from the beginning.,1
I typically would not care in the slightest about things like that but I feel as if since my good friends basically turned their backs on me that I am at a loss? If my good friends did before does that mean everyone else will too? **TLDR: GF and I broke up. She is trying to turn people against me. What can I do?,1

"I've been out of work for nine months, and it's finally catching up to me. When I lost my job in January, I took a sabbatical for a few months; it was necessary at the time. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have set up my phone with call blockers when the bill collectors began calling. I couldn't tell the difference between a potential employer and something which would stress me out given the slew of incoming calls with unknown numbers.

"Sometimes, when I finally got out of bed and stood up, I felt like ""Ugh, *finally*"". Still, it did not happen every morning, and even when it did, I still felt rested from the long sleep, so I thought no more of it. Also, they were never nightmares. Sadly, my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months, and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life. The only benefit left in the medicine was the mild mental cushioning it provided, but at the same time I started to suspect that what I needed wasn't cushioning but to make new constructive life decisions, that only I could make.",0

Things were so good again. Just like the beginning. Then the yelling comes back. I got really sick and had to go to the hospital and he refused to come and visit me when I was home.

"I'm fine, or so I thought. All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on. I've tried so many different types of medications and combinations thereof, more than 10 for sure, and even underwent electro-convulsive therapy, but nothing helped. It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided. I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",0
"I do not know if I ought to, to be honest. I determined to quit drinking nine months ago, and have been sober seven weeks. But I never had any desire to quit grass, and I still don't.

She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety.",1

"Hey guys, I'm not homeless myself, I'm just after some advice. Basically, I work in a restaurant that closes late so I'm often not back to my apartment complex until around midnight. For the last few nights when I come back, I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway.

"My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
"This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor. It has become a one sided physical relationship. I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months. I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.",1
I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand.

Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,0

Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.",1
"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.  He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis.

"For no reason, I'll just wake up with anxiety like feelings. Stomach ache, uneasiness, some sort of dread, or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack. I don't understand why and it can last for a long time. Anyways. Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it, but it doesn't fully help.",1
"All these sexual abuse accusations, while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse, I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.",1
"Not like triggers per say, because I'd have to ask her about that, but more general behaviors. Like, if I see her acting in a certain way that is common to abuse victims, I should know to be careful around that. Like apologizing a lot is a common behavior. Knowing about the abuse, I didn't try and correct her or anything (save one time when she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do that). So any additional information is useful.",0

I keep on getting crap from non work people about oh just fly. I try to psyche myself up to do it but after the 5 minutes of feeling like “yeah I can do it” I feel beyond tense. Anyone been in a similar spot? What did you end up doing? Thanks!,1
I’ve put my family through it too many times and it’s putting a strain on my relationship. I’m not who I used to be. And because of that I’m afraid people are going to leave me. My partner especially. He’s seen me go through this before and I’m afraid he’s going to give up on me.,1
Everyone loved him. He told the best stories and cooked the best food and was funny. All my friends thought he was the coolest person ever. He also has untreated bipolar disorder. Anyway - back in December he hit her so bad (using an object) that the next day she passed out at work and her coworkers forced her to get medial attention ) - she went the hospital - her sister went to meet her - and because it was mentioned that a minor lived in the house - social workers and the police got involved.,0

"My boyfriend and I generally have a good relationship. We've lived together for about a year and a half, and we have a pretty good partnership going. He's the first guy I've been with who is willing to sit down and really hash things out if we're having an issue. However there is one topic he *won't* hash out with me, and that's that sometimes he asks me questions out of no where that to me feel kind of like little ""pop quizzes"" that I feel are designed to try to catch me off guard and stump me. He'll randomly pose a riddle or ask a logic question, then I kind of fumble because I feel like I have to come up with an answer quickly, or I just get exasperated and tell him I'm not in the mood for a pop quiz.",1

When I try to befriend artists or thinkers or doers. They often either shun me because my work has been sub par and nearly non existant and they don't see me as equal. Or they show sexual/romantic interest I don't reciprocate which makes me nervous and avoidant. Sometimes I am shunmed I think because they mistake my interest in making friends for a romantic interest. I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.,1
I'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food. I have my state's basic free insurance OHP (Oregon Health Plan) but I'm not sure what kind of psychological services they could provide.

Cut to yesterday... My parents booked me in for an emergency appointment with the DR because my anxiety and depression is so bad I cannot function day to day and spend most of my time stuck in bed panicking. I was prescribed 2mg Valium to go alongside my anti-depressants. I took one and within 15 minutes I went from SEVERE anxiety to COMPLETE calmness Well... here comes the paranoia associated with my bad cannabis trip years ago... I FREAKED.,1
"He also said that Brian's mother made comments like she hopes she gets hit by a bus and she's so depressed because I'm doing this to her. (No mention has ever been made by them how much our daughter is having to miss out on by having this medical issue let alone what their own son is being put through from their lack of respect.) The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter. The fact that we're withholding her from their toxic behavior right now might be a turning point for him to grow a pair in his own marriage. I'm not holding my breath, but I have a little bit of hope.",0

Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family.

But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom.

To be more specific, we always end up talking extensively about marriage, what to name our daughter, how many golden retrievers to get and the like.

We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-he’s leaving in about 15 minutes. I’m really scared and I think he’ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so we’re probably going to have to get a restraining order.

Well I guess it was my second. Last week we set the ground work for the safe space to come back to if things got too overwhelming. This week we began to work through my trauma.

I was ghosted this past summer by one of few people I've ever wanted to have a relationship with, and the subsequent weeks were a quest to find sex that would distract me from the pain. Others came before, but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future, and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me, and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.",1
"When I was 16 I met a guy on vacation 11 years my senior... Having never been able to get along with those in my age group, I thought nothing of somebody older spending time with me, as I had grown up always spending my time around the adults during the holidays or my older brother's friends... Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies... He played nice for my vacation-- respecting my boundaries and acting only as a friend. He showed me the island and was nothing but kind and hospitable to my family...",0
"so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).",1

He immediately went into 30,000 debt building an unnecessary smithy and had to get a job so we couldn't start the business after all. I bought a used car so I could get out sometimes and look for a job, he took the car to work (instead of his retired parent's car as planned) so I was stuck at home again.

I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned.

"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point. My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1

"He seemed satisfied with this and kept pouring me drinks. Eventually he decided to close up for the night and I went back up to the house, tipsy and confused about what had just happened, but glad I had bargained some time. I got myself on the dole and the rope that was against my neck seemed to loosen just a little bit. However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies.

"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures. She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me... I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation."" In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",0
"He suddenly wanted to have a relationship with her, which I saw as a good thing. I said he could come over to visit as often as he wanted, he just needs to tell me before hand so I can be home.

We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid.

Marie starts taking this personally for some reason and then says to all of us that he’s “always ruining her nights out”.",0
"I’m currently doing EMDR for my severe anxiety issues and depression. We’re going through past instances that have plagued me and are why my mindset is a negative shithole. I had my anxiety in a certain place, where I felt comfortable. The anxiety was there but I managed it well enough. Things were not perfect and there was still a lot of things that needed to change in order for me to progress.",1
"I am 25 years old and recently had to stay with my mother and her new husband. My mom has had issues on and off throughout my childhood, but it is only recently that I identified her as a narcissist. We used to be very close (inappropriately so), but last week she disowned me and asked me to move out over a Reddit post she found of mine (not this account). I am moving out on Sunday, and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.",1
"He's exactly what I've needed, maintains his side of an equal partnership, etc. My only problem is that, though our sex life is great, I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes, even if he shows no interest that occasional day, then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day. It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea. He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations. I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.",0
I just wanted to thank everyone on this sub reddit for answering my crazy questions. Also for answering my questions with obvious answers when I was too crazy to see the answers. I have been homeless for 3 months. Not anymore! I have my own room I'm renting from a very nice family.,0
"Certain things will make me feel uncomfortable. as of recently she will jokingly play with my nipples, like suck on them or biting them if we are laying in bed and I’m shirtless. This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all. I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it. She will keep jokingly doing so and tell me stop being a baby or that she is just joking around.",1
"Edit: She has seen a therapist that diagnosed her with PTSD based on a fear of tornadoes (that she has never been directly affected by other than her parent, father, having them go into a basement as one was nearby). I believe this to be a slight misdiagnosis and the focus of the treatment to be incorrect. I'm looking for support from others that have had similar experiences and perhaps know a bit more about the differences between PD, PTSD, and CPTSD. Going to attempt to summarize the background info with bullet points. -Together for 5 years, married for 1.",0
"But in that moment neither my words nor my body made a difference...he did what he wanted.... I wanted to push him, kick him, shout...but...i couldnt move. There were times he didn't listen to me but I never thought it would lead to him forcing himself onto me. I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.",1
"I was trying to eat my food but my hands became shaky and i then didnt feel hungry. People kept asking me why my hands are shaky, and the people across from me laughing at me. Idk what to do, ive worked here for 3 years but i just cant get over my anxiety. I just hate having meetings and celebrating with co workers. I havent been diagnose for anxiety disorder but i want to been on medication?",1
If you knew Garret you would never have seen this coming. The family is exhausted at this point. I just want to do anything I can to help them and this is the platform I have. Any little thing helps. I can't think of a more caring family that is totally deserving of any help they can get.,0
"Anytime I have a scheduled transaction towards my checking account, my wages are immediately garnished. However, last night was the real wake up call. After work, I came home drunk and let my stress get the best of me. I ended up getting in a fight with my gf about money, finances and utilities. Not wanting to face the pathetic reality that I have ""sugar momma"" for a girlfriend, I packed everything I own in my vehicle, parked it less than a mile away (incase I may have forgotten anything) and slept in it until the battery died.",1
"Kinda interesting how even when I’m not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if it’s the biological sleepiness or if it’s kinda a pavlovian response because I’m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway, how are you all doing?",1
"Hi, I am 21 years old, I used to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety last year, but somehow managed to beat it and live like a normal person again. But from time to time, i have this weird feeling that I am gonna pass out or something like that, my face is pale and I feel this uncomfortable pressure in my eye balls, it happens when I'm at university during class or even during normal daily activities. I did some blood tests and everything is fine, so is this anxiety again?",1
"Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....",1
"First and foremost, I am not a veteran. I found out about PTSD service dogs from my good friend who also suffers from PTSD and is in the process of training her pup to be a service dog. I have found some helpful resources online giving information about service dogs for PTSD, but most of them seem to be geared toward either: therapy dogs or PTSD dogs only for veterans. <url> ➡️ are all trainings this expensive? <url> ➡️ awesome article, but this website is also for veterans",0
"I see him in person 1 - 3 times per week, almost always at restaurants. If it matters, we've never been to each others apartment. It is in his lease that he can't have guests over (???). I've invited him to mine but it hasn't worked out. I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me, so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.",1
"When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac. 3 years later, I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks. That actually seemed to work well and I've been off the prozac for about a year and even got off Facebook 3 months ago because it was becoming a point of unneeded drama, but I'm suddenly getting the depression symptoms again. I've walled myself off from most people and have become less communicative with my husband. I don't like going to our neighbors house because I have a paranoia that 2 of them don't like me.",1
"I was cleaning my house with bleach, got a nasty burn in my throat when I woke up the next day. Day later it went away, but the day after that I got the worst body aches, chills, 100.6 fever, and dizziness for 2 days. It all cleared up but I have had this dry cough for 4 days now with no relief, it keeps me up at night, and I go into these coughing fits. What should I Do? I can't see a doctor for 2 more weeks as I am out of town on a job, i think I am a hypocongiract so ii worry a lot lol.",1
"I have almost constant health anxiety. It's a mixture of agoraphobia and health anxiety. I'm afraid of having some incurable disease or suddenly stopping breathing... I've been kinda iffy the past few days, just tired from lack of sleep, and I usually feel like shit after my period which triggers my anxiety. Well anyway I went out to meet my mom for some food and the first thing she says to me is ""wow are you okay?""",1
"I did something once that I had been doing almost constantly in the intervening years: I imagined my ex-fiancee. But this time, it felt real. ""Through the lord, all things are possible"" Shock, bliss, happiness, peace, closure, and many other emotions multiplied beyond reckoning coursed through me. I promised my life to God, and continue to believe that he did speak to me.",0
"I don't have a therapist right now, and I don't really talk much to anyone about this. Right now, I can articulate how it feels, because it's still fresh. But when I'm feeling good, I have trouble discussing my anxiety. It's not something I want to delve into when I'm in a good mood. I'm not really sure where I was going with this or what I'm looking for, but I just wanted to vent since this was fresh on my mind right now.",0
"I spent six years in a very abusive relationship. We had a child together. After she was born, I made my way out. I ended up fleeing several houses and apartments trying to stay away from him. There’s been a long history.",1
"He said he’d never love us. He acknowledges and plays with his daughter starting after she turned 6 months. He use to threaten to take her away from me. He gets delusional at times and he yelled at me “I’m going to off myself if you don’t admit that you were going to call the cops on me for calling the manager at McDonald’s an asshole!” I filmed it. So he said, “here’s your daughter try not to off yourself” He really thinks I’m going to kill myself for no reason....",0
Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success. Because the carpet is cover in pee from animals and reminds me of my mothers house. How i used to go to school every morning covered in cat and dog urine. Every little bit of confrontation feels like world war 3 in my head. Every little feels like it gets put on me as blame and i cant deal.,1
"Do I live in this cycle forever? Is there really no chance for me? I can't even begin to explain how my sibling got out, it was pure luck and they are heavily dependent on an S/O. I feel like I'm grabbing at straws. I've done this song and dance a million times.",1
"I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him. He was too big for them to punish. So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything. They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly. Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.",1
"I haven't posted here yet, but as everyone here has probably experienced, PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school, I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason, dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.",1
He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done. He kept packing. So I called the police. I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option. The police department chose not to press charges.,1
I need help. I need sound advice on how I can overcome this situation. I need brutal honesty. Merci ! Please excuse my grammatical errors,1
Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.,1
"I just got an email to schedule an interview for a job. I haven’t heard from the lady a few days after thinking it would take her a few days to figure a time for me to come in and email back. Nope she CALLED ME on the home phone instead today. First off I didn’t know because the caller ID said cellular call and usually I don’t answer those calls because their scams. I later looked up the number I have an app that tells if it’s a scam number, what business it is, landline etc.",0
"I can't get over this feeling. Nothing feels good. I just finished spring break and I had a chance to work out every day. Even when I was working out, I felt overwhelmingly anxious. I can't state concisely what I'm thinking.",1
"I've never done this before but we always stay at my house, so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit. She said my eyes were open and I don't know if she believes it was accidental... How can I manage this situation? That's all I really need to know, I don't know what to do.",1
"If they weren't done he would get angry at her. After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money. Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted. The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later."" While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.",1
"She says she's sorry and that she would never have taken it to a physical place, and completely rejected the first co-workers request to take it further. However she continued to talk to him and also continued to talk and flirt with the second co-worker, when she knew he had romantic feelings. She says she's sorry and has an addiction to being desired. I told her it's not fair to me or the men she's leading on. She agrees and is trying to convince me to stay with her.",1
I don't know if I should call it abuse. Fiancé suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight. Last night was the 2nd time but far worse. He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet). My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...,1
"It's like Everyone else is allowed to be frustrated but me. So I use a lot of my UPT (unpaid time off; it's the ONLY time off we get, no vacation or anything) for my sister - her wedding (a whole fucking week), her kids' birthdays that she insists I be at, and things like their baptisms. And I know I use a lot of my hours on them, but overlook it because I love them and know they want to see me. But I only have 6 hours left, and each shift is 4 hours. I might have to use 4 of those today because the front of my house is flooded (there's a car stuck there and an officer blocking off people from entering), because I emailed HR and even sent in a picture but this company just doesn't give a fuck and probably won't cancel.",1

He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him. He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise. I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him. The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him. And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,1

"I'll try to keep this short and succint so it's easier to read. I had a very brief relationship with this girl. We both conected inmediately and tried to be in a relationship. We both had problems that consumed us: she was bulimic and I had erections issues; we both had parent issues and a nihilistic aproach to life. I wasn't a (mentally) strong boy, I was very immature and naive, I suppose she was kind of the same.",0
"Picked music up again and I'm considering the possibility of doing it for the rest of my life rather than science, which is what I've been led by my environment to believe is my ""destiny."" Even if I am coming to plenty of realizations, I constantly ponder about our relationship, how horribly it ended, and whether I may have done something wrong and how I can fix a bad quality in myself that made things end that way. I just want to forget. Is this horribly written? I think so.",0
I’m coming to find that my family are rapist sympathizers given the “right” circumstance (ie. sports). How would you want the media to change? What would make it easier to watch the news while also covering newsworthy topics? My head is in a fog still so hopefully that all made sense.,1
"It’s like hes expecting my tummy is spilling over my jeans like a muffin(it’s not) I’m still a size small instead of an Xsmall like I used to be when 14 but that’s pretty fucking normal I reckon.its like god help me if I’m a medium right? Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight. Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.

"This is marriage #2 for both of us. Husband's (52 M) ex (51 F) cheated, my ex (53 M) had emotional affair, leading to ending marriages in the same year.

Before getting engaged I found out he was having an emotional affair with a woman who lived about a 5 hour drive away from us. I found out when he left an IM open on his computer, found steamy texts when I went to shut off a noisy program.",1

I’m just wondering how many of you have A LOT of triggers? I was abused extremely horribly as a teenager and into adulthood and I have horrible ptsd from it.

"You’re swimming smoothly with the current, the temperature isn’t too cold, and the water is calm and clear blue. So why can you only ever see it as being murky? Sometimes, you find yourself swimming higher and higher, until your fingers skim the interface between the water and the air above.

But gosh, I would like someone to talk to about day to day life, hopes, worries, goals, etc. Also, I have an eleven year old son for whom I would like to model some more healthy platonic relationships.

She said she had to know and I told her that I would but she couldn’t turn it into an issue because this all happened before I even knew her. She agreed.

"I have a very hard time with trying to find a job, from most places I don't get any feedbacks, but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower, while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences, political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason, etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects), my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik), not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part, but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit, such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry, which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles, game consoles, phones, etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic, because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist). My father is seriously thinking on kicking me out to the streets if I won't pay, which makes me to go back to my mother, and my abusive stepfather who cannot accept my autistic quirks, implying if I can go back to them and my stepfather will let it all go through.",1
"Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.",1
"We broke up a month ago because the distance made us miserable. We had only been doing long distance for 3-ish months, which is not long at all, but we had been dating before that for roughly 3 years, with a short break in between. I'm taking a gap year so I've been bouncing from place to place & my parents are so protective that they don't let me visit friends at college often (especially not her since they are suspicious of our relationship anyway [homophobia lol]). I did visit her once, but only for a few days and she visited me in return. Anyway, we both couldn't commit to a strict schedule of meeting up because of school, parents, money...",0
When I take the time to relax and think of something nice like a waterfall or a forest or something like that I then automatically think of how bad people are going to mess it up and pollute and make it worse and just be awful. It makes it hard for me to relax. I try to think of something tranquil and then thoughts like these pop into my head. Meditation isn't that nice for me. My mind just races.,1
"It feels as if no one understands what I’m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didn’t tell anyone until now. I really didn’t think it was that bad. Now that I’m out of the situation, it still haunts me. I feel guilty and still like it’s all my fault somehow even though it’s irrational and not true. Does anyone else feel like this?",1
"So I have a buddy who still lives with his step dad, mom, and brother. Long story short, I just found out through him that his step dad hits him and occasionally his mother. It came out when he was drunk along with other behaviors. When my friend gets drunk he likes to aggravate people until they try to beat him up and until recently I just thought he liked fighting. But he told me it is because his step dad hits him so getting in fights gives him a weird sense of worth.",0
"I really like my roommate, and my suitemates are cool besides for them being loud at night. I know I'd sleep better in a different place, but...I don't know. I don't want to put up with the hassle. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. I honestly just came here to vent.",0
"I walk up to the door, unlock it and open it. It's K. With my boyfriend standing by in sight I ask him what he's doing here. He says nothing but stares at me with this blank stare. Then I get this weird gut feeling and ask ""have you been drinking?"" In which he shakes his head.",1

&#x200B; I'm in our room watching some relaxing Youtube videos trying to cheer myself up. My boyfriend wants me to come out and do weekend stuff but the energy is so high out there I think it'll set off an attack.

"I went on a holiday with my best friend [26M] and husband [26M]. My husband and I have been together for ten years (married for six). My best friend and I have known each other for three years, and spend a huge amount of time chatting with each other on the internet. I love him to death, and he makes me insanely happy. My friend lives decently far away, so we don't see each other often.",0
"So lets forget all about my biological father. My father once told me : ""Money do not fall from tree's"", but, boy oh boy, was I ever going to show him wrong. It all started with the fact that one day I got out of bed, and had the weird idea that I was going to die at 21 yrs old. I was listening to The Doors at that point, and Black Sabbath and everything in between those two. And while listening to The Doors, it opened the the doors of perception to me.",0

Could we all at least help out by chipping in at least a dollar for this van? Could we please give this family a break by helping and donating for this van!? These boys and her need it so much!! It would be worth every penny to be able to go on more play dates with her two boys and make their little live’s more adventurous. It would open up a door to giving them easier and more convenience access to fun spontaneous trips to go play and have fun.,0
"I think this is a good conversation to have in person, but I likely won't see him for months. Would it be tacky/wildly unromantic to do this over text/email? Additionally, I don't want to ruin things between us or make things weird, and I'm not sure how to broach the subject. How do I not screw this up?   ---",1
"Meet with her today and express this is a concern for me. She says she doesn't see what the big deal is, people make mistakes and forget things. I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about. She doesn't agree, we talk about it. She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.",0
"So I knocked and told her to please let me in. She refused, I told her I was sorry and I didn’t mean any of the things I said and that I love her very much. She said to go away so I did (we were at her house). Now a whole day passed and she still refuses to talk to me :( I’m worried, guilty and just want to hug her and tell her again that I’m sorry. I sent her some messages but she ignored them.",1
"He has even made a comment to my bf about me being overweight. Being overweight has basically taken over my relationship, my mind, and my life. This year, I am making it a priority to lose the weight, especially since I have nothing else occupying my mind like cancer. My confidence level right now is 0 and I feel so fucking ugly and fat. If I just got in shape, I know that I would be close to a 10.",1
"I generally like to finish the stuff I do that I consider to be work related but some things like video games, series or anything like that I don’t want to end. I am scared of finishing them since I know going back to it won’t be the same. After I finish them everything about it just feels so empty, like it has no value anymore. Knowing I can never experience it the same way again makes me not want it to end. I go from loving it and then afterwards never wanting anything to do with it anymore.",0
I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling? But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break. I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything. I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,1
"For example, she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s. She has been in a lot of fights over the years, but in general isn't usually physically violent - it's usually manipulation. I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his. He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private. She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.",1
"This is the first time that i'm opening up about this, so please be kind. I'm from India - stereotypically known as the land of doctors and engineers. And while that's just a stereotype, my studies give me anxiety. I had my first attack two years ago - and I have been talking to people since then - but my recent graduation exams have left me worse then ever. What i want to know is, when was your first attack and how are you doing now?",1
The place where I was going for therapy decided that they couldn't appropriately treat me. I've had a tough time finding another therapist. The strange thing is I've been feeling better out of therapy then when I was in it. I was doing a type of exposure therapy and it was rough. I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma.,0
"First off, I want to apologize for posting here so often. I don't have anywhere else to turn to. I recently contacted my abuser. I don't know why, I think it's part of my self destructive behavior. And I've realized something.",1
"So I'm feeling a bit lost with this. I've had asthma ever since I was a little kid and it has been flaring up really bad over the last few weeks... I think. Actually I'm not sure if that's what it really is. I recently got a prescription for trazodone (about six weeks ago), and it has helped with having fewer nightmares.",0
"The thought of helping people, curing diseases and caring for someone makes me happy. Imagine a person who’s an asshole but need help on health, I would help him/her. However, I need to finance med but I need to work on my current stature to get the money but this job makes me anxious to the point that I am having refluxes because of stress just the thought of working on it. The problem with me is I know I can do for the meantime this job but it was a mistaken path, I could have done dev since it involves little customer interaction. I felt helpless because I need the money but feels like I am fooling myself to work my ass up for something that is not my passion.",1
"My ex thought that show was terrific inspiration. He used it to discuss “what if”s with his guy friends, who I hope had no idea how real he is about that shit. I called it “The Rape Along/Beat Along Show” for the longest time. I still do when Gramma isn’t listening. Last time I unexpectedly came across the DVD set (Grampy accidentally left it at my place on the kitchen table, and, yes, he’d been told not to leave it where I might see it)...",0

I became so angry, my anxiety was off the charts and I couldn’t focus on anything at hand.

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns.

"Hi, I'm 14F and because of health issues I missed a lot of school and eventually started homeschooling this year I didn't have any friends at public schools and I just sit in the house all day now. I can't join a sports team because of formerly mentioned health issues and I live in a town where a car is a necessity so it's not like I can walk anywhere but I'd like to make friends or just get out of my house for the first time in months and socialize face to face any ideas as to what I can do. TL;DR: I'm homeschooled lonely and can't join a sports team how do I make friends.",1
So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1
After the 6 months we moved to a really big house the next town over. It was 3 times the size of the one that burned down. My mom got fired though from nursing because she was caught stealing drugs. My dad graduated college and had a good job in IT and a newspaper place. I don't understand how they could afford such a big house.,0
And it’s okay to fall down and have a bad day- as long as you pick yourself up and continue working toward moving forward. Moving forward does NOT mean forgiving and forgetting or condoning any behaviors. Moving forward is about YOU and beginning to live the life YOU deserve. You are beautiful. You are smart.,0
"The gist of the comments received was the K isn't going to change and I should get B to go to counselling to help her with her self-esteem and give her some outside input.

Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.",0

"In prison, I was housed with two other person, we already had planned to take over the leadership of the gang that had control of our wing. We were making weapon, I got into a fight with one of the guy. I knew I was getting out soon, but I couldn't tell people, so I acted as if I was there  until my court date.

"And whose fault is that, then? My question to you; is it the tree’s fault that it never bothered to put in the effort to correct itself, or the hypothetical forest’s? Is it anyone’s fault at all?

"But now, my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone.

"Anyway, he bullshited that her insurance wasn't covered  by anyone in this state, and that it was illegal for him to refuse her her shift. My SO had already talked to his HR head. They had previously decided that there wasn't much they could do unless she came up to him. Then tonight happened, the head of HR is severely worried for her safety (and my SOs) in a way he wasn't before. The head has called the Domestic Violence Hotline himself, and is looking for resources to help him solve this very delicate/tricky issue.",0
"Should I just go ahead and get help? Am I worried about nothing? Is there a way to lose the worst bits of anxiety while keeping the bits that are perhaps somewhat helpful? Or have I got this all wrong and it's not anxiety (but perhaps something else) that makes me productive, etc? Or should I just accept all the awesome things in my life as a totally worthwhile price for feeling worried?",1
"I had suicidal thoughts while working at the island. I had to cut it short and come back home. I was too sad to continue. Eddy and I reunited, and I assumed we were back together since it seemed so. When he got drunk he would literally switch back and forth to being happy and giggly to wanting to die and hating himself.",1
Can anyone relate to this feeling? I can’t enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. I’m not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance. When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out. Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.,1

A few years ago I witnessed an accident at this time of year and I am beginning to remember it again. At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying. I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1

"This is an idea that my father also reinforced in me heavily. I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely). Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim. I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass, I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted. My last relationship was a while ago, and lasted about a year.",1
