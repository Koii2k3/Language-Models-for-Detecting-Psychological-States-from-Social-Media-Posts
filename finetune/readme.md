# Model Files

This folder contains the model notebook and configuration files used in our research.  It includes pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, and LLaMA, along with any fine-tuned versions and associated training configurations.

The folder is organized into subfolders based on the specific model architecture and potentially by experiment or fine-tuning run.

## Subfolder

*   **`BERT/`:** Contains folders related to BERT models.
*   **`RoBERTa/`:** Contains folders related to RoBERTa models.
*   **`LLaMA/`:** Contains folders related to LLaMA models.

* Other subfolders may be added as needed for new models or experiments.

## Usage
Run the notebooks in this folder to train, evaluate, and fine-tune the models. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained and include all necessary code and documentation.
